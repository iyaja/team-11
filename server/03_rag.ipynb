      "\"Several commenters raised questions about potential impacts to Bi-State sage-grouse, a special status species under consideration for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Project site does not support suitable habitat for Bi-State sage-grouse, and it is not located within any mapped habitat identified in the 2016 Record of Decision and Land Use Plan Amendment for the Nevada and California Greater Sage Grouse Bi-State Distinct Population Segment in the Carson City and Tonopah Field Office (2016 Bi-State Sage Grouse Plan Amendment). This species is addressed in the Draft EIS, given questions and concerns, despite it not being present nor having any potential to be directly or indirectly affected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*Impact Summary:*\n",
      "\n",
      "No direct or indirect impacts are anticipated to Bi-State sage-grouse due to the absence of suitable habitat and the species' non-presence within the project site. The gen-tie alignment avoids critical habitats and includes mitigation measures to protect sensitive environmental resources as detailed in Section 3.8.4.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3.8.4 Mitigation Measures**\n",
      "\n",
      "Mitigation measures to protect special status species, including endangered species, are critical to ensure compliance with federal and state regulations and to minimize potential adverse effects. Specific measures for yellow-billed cuckoo include:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Section 3.8.4.2 Yellow-Billed Cuckoo Mitigation:**\n",
      "- Timing construction to avoid the migratory period.\n",
      "- Establishing exclusion zones to protect sensitive areas during construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Bi-State sage-grouse, general considerations include ensuring alternative routes and methods to minimize potential disturbances, even though direct impacts are not anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed Libra Solar Project includes comprehensive consideration of potential impacts to wildlife, specifically addressing endangered and special status species. The Draft EIS acknowledges the legislative and regulatory framework governing such species and incorporates mitigation measures designed to avoid and minimize impacts. The findings suggest that while potential presence exists for species like the yellow-billed cuckoo, proactive measures will mitigate adverse effects, and the Bi-State sage-grouse does not show any immediate risk due to habitat absence. This approach ensures compliance with the ESA and other relevant regulations, further supported by interagency coordination and public comments.\n"
