The Project site is in Mineral County and Lyon County,\nNevada, approximately 55 miles southeast of the Reno metropolitan area and 11 miles southeast of the\ntown of Yerington. The expected life of the Project is 30 years.\n\nThe BLM has prepared this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS) with input from\ncooperating agencies and American Indian Tribes to address the impacts of the Project. The cooperating\nagencies include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Nevada\nDepartment of Wildlife, Mineral County, and Lyon County. This Draft EIS evaluates the Proposed\nAction, three alternatives to the Proposed Action, and the No Action Alternative. The Proposed Action\nand the alternatives involve development within a requested right-of-way that includes the same solar site;\nhowever, each action/alternative differs in how the facility would be constructed, the components that\nwould be constructed including the generation-tie (gen-tie) line, and the site access routes used during\nconstruction. The Proposed Action would involve solar development utilizing traditional development\nmethods, which include disk and roll to remove vegetation in the solar array areas. Alternative 1 would\nreduce disturbance to major washes, vegetation, and soils within the solar array areas by locating\ndevelopment areas outside of the major washes and providing guidelines to limit vegetation disturbance\nduring construction. Alternative 1 includes alternative construction methods such as drive and crush, the\ngoal being to maintain vegetation root structures and to promote restoration over the lifespan of the\nProject. Alternative 2 would provide supplemental access during construction to disperse some of the\nconcentrated vehicle trips anticipated under the Proposed Action. Alternative 3 entails connecting the\ngen-tie line from the Project to the proposed Greenlink West Transmission Project through a new\nswitching station under the Greenlink West line, removing the need for approximately 23.6 miles of gentie, when compared to the Proposed Action. The No Action Alternative would be a continuation of\nexisting conditions. The alternatives were developed using input from the public, stakeholders, tribal\ninterests, and cooperating agencies. Environmental and planning issues addressed include impacts on\nrecreational off-highway vehicle access. Impacts to grazing allotments, transportation, and environmental\njustice are also evaluated.\n\n**Review Period:** Comments on the Draft EIS for the Libra Solar Project will be accepted for 45 calendar\ndays following publication of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Notice of Availability in the\nFederal Register. Comments can be submitted through the National BLM NEPA Register website, listed\nbelow. All comments must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. on February 5, 2024.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nMelanie Hornsby, Project Manager (775) 885-6000\nBureau of Land Management, Carson City District\n5665 Morgan Mill Rd.\nCarson City, NV 89701\nEmail: blm_nv_ccdo_libra_solar@blm.gov\nNational BLM NEPA Register Website: https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanningui/project/2022592/510\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_DOI-BLM-NV-C000-2023-0001-EIS_\n\n### Table of Contents\n#### Volume 1: EIS\n**ES.

Executive Summary\n\n##### ES-1 Introduction\n\n**Overview**\nThis Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS) has been prepared by the United States (U.S.)\nDepartment of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This Draft EIS analyzes effects of and\nalternatives to the Libra Solar Project (Proposed Action or Project) described in the Plan of Development (POD)\nsubmitted by Arevia Power, LLC (Applicant). The BLM has prepared this Draft EIS in accordance with the\nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (Title 42 of the _United States Code_ [U.S.C.] 4321 _et seq._ )\nand the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA Implementing Regulations (Title 40 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500-1508), revised as of May 20, 2022. The BLM is the Lead Agency for this\nDraft EIS pursuant to 40 CFR 1501.7.\n\nSection 3104 of the Energy Act of 2020 (codified at 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 3004) directs the Secretary of the Interior to\nissue permits that, in total, authorize production of at least 25 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from wind, solar,\nand geothermal projects by 2025. Additionally, Executive Order 14082 requires federal agencies to prioritize\npromoting construction of clean energy generation, storage, and transmission, and enabling technologies\nthrough efficient, effective mechanisms that incorporate community engagement.\n\n**Purpose and Need**\nThe need for the action (processing the Applicant\u2019s Application) is to respond to the Applicant\u2019s request for a\nright-of-way (ROW) authorization to construct, operate, maintain, and decommission the proposed Project in\naccordance with BLM\u2019s responsibility under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and 43\nCFR Part 2800. The need for the action is also created by BLM\u2019s obligation to contribute towards the\nachievement of the goals established in Section 3104 of the Energy Act of 2020 and Executive Order 14057\nthrough the development of renewable energy production on federal public land.\n\nThe purpose of BLM\u2019s action is to determine if the Applicant\u2019s project and alternatives are consistent with\nrelevant laws, regulations, and policies, and to consider whether to grant, grant with modifications, or deny the\nROW.\n\n**Decisions to be Made**\nThe BLM will decide whether to deny the proposed ROW, grant the ROW, or grant the ROW with\nmodifications. A ROW, if granted, would include terms, conditions, and stipulations that the BLM determines to\nbe in the public interest and may include modifying the proposed use or changing the location of the proposed\nfacilities (43 CFR 2805.10(a)(1)).\n\n##### ES-2 Proposed Action and Alternatives\n\n**Introduction**\nIn accordance with the CEQ\u2019s NEPA Regulations (40 CFR \u00a7 1502.14), an EIS must present the environmental\nimpacts of a proposed action, no action, and other reasonable action alternatives, as well as provide a\ncomparison of the impacts by alternative. The EIS must define the issues such that the public and decision\nmakers can readily understand them, thus contributing to a basis for an informed and reasoned decision.\n\nAlternatives to the Proposed Action were developed by the BLM to avoid or reduce various resource conflicts.\nResource conflicts include loss of habitat for wildlife species, changes to drainages and hydrology, loss of\ngrazing land for rangeland permittees, traffic, socio-economic impacts from an influx of workers to construct the\nfacility, and dust generation during construction.\n\nJanuary 2024 ES-1\n\n\n-----\n\nThree alternatives to the Proposed Action were developed in response to issues raised by the public and agencies\nduring scoping. One alternative addresses alternative methods to construct the facility to preserve vegetation and\nsite hydrology. Another alternative specifically addresses adding supplemental construction access. The last\nalternative presents an option for reducing effects of the Project\u2019s method for connecting to the regional\ntransmission system.\n\nSeveral other alternatives were identified and considered but were eliminated from detailed analysis. Additional\ninformation on the development and details of the alternatives to the Proposed Action is provided in Section 2,\nincluding other alternatives considered but eliminated from further analysis and the rationale for eliminating\nthem from detailed analysis. The following sections provide an overview of the Proposed Action and the\nalternatives carried forward for analysis in this Draft EIS.\n\n**Proposed Action**\nThe Applicant is requesting BLM authorization to construct, operate, maintain, and decommission a 700megawatt (MW) photovoltaic solar electric generating facility and ancillary facilities. The proposed on-site solar\nfacilities include 34.5 kilovolt (kV) above ground or underground collector lines, a 2.8-acre operation and\nmaintenance (O&M) facility, an 8.3-acre substation facility, a battery energy storage system, internal access\nroads, access roads along a generation tie line (gen-tie) line, a perimeter road, perimeter fencing, a water storage\ntank for fire protection, drainage control features, and an on-site water well. The Project would result in the\npermanent disturbance of approximately 3,420 acres within the 5,778-acre ROW application area. The Project\nsite is in Mineral County and Lyon County, Nevada, approximately 55 miles southeast of the Reno metropolitan\narea and 11 miles southeast of the town of Yerington.\n\n**Alternatives**\nSeveral potential alternatives were identified and considered by the Applicant and the BLM. Of the various\nalternatives considered, the No Action, the Proposed Action, and three additional alternatives were identified for\nanalysis in the Draft EIS, listed here:\n\n1. Alternative 1: Major Drainage Avoidance, Fenced Corridors, and Vegetation and Topography\n\nMaintenance\n\n2. Alternative 2: Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction\n3. Alternative 3: Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West\n\nEach action alternative includes approval of a ROW grant by BLM. The Major Drainage Avoidance, Fenced\nCorridors, and Vegetation and Topography Maintenance Alternative would modify the Proposed Action to\nreduce disturbance to major washes and vegetation and soils within the solar site by avoiding and establishing\ndevelopment areas outside of the major washes and providing guidelines for limiting vegetation disturbance\nduring construction. The Supplemental Access During Construction Alternative would also modify the Proposed\nAction to provide supplemental access during construction to disperse some of the proposed vehicle trips\nconcentrated on East Walker Road under the Proposed Action. The Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West\nAlternative would connect the gen-tie line from the Project to the proposed Greenlink West Transmission\nProject through a new switching station under the Greenlink West line. This alternative requires authorizations\nthat are not guaranteed at this time. NV Energy must support this alternative in consideration of system\noperation and integration.\n\n**No Action Alternative**\nCEQ regulations (40 CFR 1500\u20131508) for implementing NEPA require that an EIS alternatives analysis include\na No Action Alternative. In accordance with this requirement, under the No Action Alternative, BLM would\ndeny the ROW grant, the Project would not be constructed, and the BLM would continue to manage the land\nconsistent with the 2001 Carson City Field Office Consolidated Resource Management Plan (CRMP). Under the\nNo Action Alternative, the Project area would remain open for future solar development or other uses consistent\nwith the BLM statutory, regulatory, and planning guidance and policies.\n\nJanuary 2024 ES-2\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ES-3 Consultation and Coordination\n\n**Public Participation**\nNumerous opportunities for public input have occurred during BLM\u2019s NEPA decision-making process. The\nBLM published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS for the Project in the _Federal Register_ on April 24,\n2023, which initiated a 30-day public scoping period for the Project, ending on May 24, 2023. The BLM hosted\na virtual public scoping meeting for the Project on May 8, 2023. Agencies and stakeholders were notified by\npostcard of the public scoping meeting opportunity. The BLM received 25 emails and letters during the scoping\nperiod. A Scoping Report was prepared to summarize the comments received (BLM 2023) and can be found at\nthe BLM\u2019s National BLM NEPA Register website: [https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanningui/project/2022592/570](https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022592/570) . External scoping also included meetings with the grazing permit operator, meetings\nwith off-highway vehicle (OHV) users, and feedback from interested parties including the Los Angeles\nDepartment of Water and Power (LADWP) and Nevada Copper.\n\nPublication of the Draft EIS in the _Federal Register_ of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (USEPA)\nNotice of Availability (NOA) of the Draft EIS initiates a 45-day public review and comment period under\nNEPA.\n\n**Interagency Consultation and Coordination**\n\n**_Cooperating Agencies_**\nIn July 2022, the BLM sent Cooperating Agency invitation letters for the Project to federal, state, and local\nagencies. The Cooperating Agencies that accepted the invitation include USEPA; Hawthorne Army Depot; U.S.\nFish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Migratory Bird Program; Nevada Department of Wildlife; Mineral County,\nNevada; and Lyon County, Nevada.\n\n**_Tribes_**\nThe BLM has initiated government-to-government consultation with Indian Tribes, pursuant to Executive Order\n13175 of November 6, 2000 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments); American\nIndian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA); and Executive Order 13007, Indian Sacred Sites; and consistent with\nthe Programmatic Agreement for the Western Solar Plan (2012). In a separate process, Indian Tribes have also\nbeen invited to participate specifically in the NEPA review and under Section 106 of the National Historic\nPreservation Act (NHPA).\n\nThe BLM is conducting on-going government-to-government consultation with Bridgeport Indian Colony,\nFallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, Walker River Paiute\nTribe, Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, Yerington Paiute Tribe, and Yomba Shoshone Tribe. Key\nconcerns include potential impacts to the Pistone-Black Mountain Conservation Area and other nearby sensitive\ncultural sites, particularly along the gen-tie line. In a process separate from the government-to-government\nconsultation, the BLM also invited the following Tribes, which are within an extended regional area, to\nparticipate in scoping to inform the NEPA and NHPA Section 106 reviews: Moapa Band of Paiutes, Las Vegas\nPaiute Tribe, Kaibab Band of Paiutes, Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, Ely Shoshone Tribe, and Duckwater\nShoshone Tribe. The Moapa Band of Paiutes provided scoping comments on topics such as biological resources,\nvegetation removal, viewshed analyses, Project water use, and cultural resources.\n\nOn June 26, 2023, and July 12, 2023, the BLM hosted virtual tribal meetings to present the proposed action,\nshow maps of the Project facilities, and provide an overview of key resource findings based on the completed\ntechnical studies. Representatives from the Walker River Paiute Tribe, Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, and Fallon\nPaiute Shoshone Tribe participated in the meetings.\n\nThe BLM has identified potential impacts to cultural resources in this Draft EIS and is continuing discussions\nwith Tribes through formal and informal consultation to ensure that all concerns are considered in proposed\nmitigation.\n\nJanuary 2024 ES-3\n\n\n-----\n\n**_State Historic Preservation Office Consultation_**\nSection 106 of the NHPA requires that all federal agencies consider the effect of undertakings they conduct,\nlicense, approve, or fund on historic properties. The Section 106 implementing regulations at 36 CFR 800.8(c),\nallow a Federal agency to use the NEPA environmental review process to comply with Section 106 of the\nNHPA in lieu of the procedures set forth in 36 CFR 800.3 - 800.6. The BLM initiated Section 106 consultation\nwith the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation\n(ACHP) on April 14, 2022. This Section 106 consultation process is integrated with the NEPA process for the\nProject; see Chapter 4 regarding additional information on coordination and consultation. The BLM has\nconsulted with the SHPO and ACHP and will continue to consult regarding the Draft EIS consistent with the\nstandards set forth in 36 CFR 800.8(c)(1). BLM is sending eligibility determinations on resources for SHPO\nconcurrence.\n\n##### ES-4 Issues\nAreas of controversy raised during scoping by the public and agencies that are analyzed in detail in this Draft\nEIS are summarized in Table Executive Summary (ES)-1. All issues described in Table ES - 1 have been\nanalyzed in detail within the Draft EIS. Further detail is included in each respective resource sub-section within\nChapter 3. Several other resource topics in addition to those listed in the table are analyzed in the Draft EIS,\nincluding Geology, Soils, and Mineral Resources; Native American Concerns; and Transportation.\n\n**Table ES - 1** **Areas of Controversy Raised During Scoping and Analyzed in Detail**\n\n\n\n|Resource or EIS topic|Topic|\n|---|---|\n|Land use and realty|Commenters raised questions about whether the gen-tie would impact existing ROWs. An existing deenergized distribution-line ROW owned by NV Energy doing business as Sierra Pacific Power is located within the Project solar site and would need to be realigned and LADWP operates a transmission line in the vicinity of the Project.|\n|Minerals|Commenters raised questions about whether the Project would impact access to the Pumpkin Hollow Mine, located adjacent and north of the Project site. The gen-tie would cross unpatented mining claims held by Nevada Copper.|\n|Rangelands/grazing|Commenters raised questions about whether the Project could impact two active grazing allotments and pasture fences, pipelines, wells, and troughs within the Project area.|\n|Recreation|Commenters raised questions about whether the Project would impact OHV usage and race routes located in the Project area. The Nevada Off-Road Association expressed support for the Project given that key special recreational permitting (SRP) OHV routes would remain open.|\n|Visual resources|The Project is in an unclassified visual resource management (VRM) class but was assigned an interim VRM of Class IV. Commenters raised questions about the visibility of the site from Pistone-Black Mountain National Conservation Area.|\n|Water resources|The Project would have water needs that may be sourced by groundwater. Commenters raised questions about groundwater uses, drainage pattern changes and the need to avoid significant drainages with a buffer.|\n|Vegetation and noxious weeds|Invasive species can be spread by off-road vehicles and contaminate formerly weed-free areas. Commenters raised questions about weed control and integrated weed management planning, given the scale of disturbance.|\n\n\nJanuary 2024 ES-4\n\n\n-----\n\n|Resource or EIS topic|Topic|\n|---|---|\n|General wildlife; special status species; and threatened, endangered, and candidate species|Commenters raised questions about potential impacts to big game species, small mammals, and migratory birds, as well as loss of habitat and the loss of movement corridors through the solar site. Several commenters raised questions about potential impacts to Bi-State sage grouse, a special status species under consideration for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Project site does not support suitable habitat for Bi-State sage-grouse and it is not located within any mapped habitat identified in the 2016 Record of Decision and Land Use Plan Amendment for the Nevada and California Greater Sage Grouse Bi-State Distinct Population Segment in the Carson City and Tonopah Field Office (2016 Bi-State Sage Grouse Plan Amendment) (BLM 2016). This species is addressed in the Draft EIS, given questions and concerns, despite it not being present nor having any potential to be directly or indirectly affected. The USFWS raised concerns regarding yellow-billed cuckoo, a federally listed endangered species. This species has not been documented in or near the Project area during recent surveys, nor in the past. The species could, theoretically, migrate along the Walker River corridor. A single crossing of the gen-tie occurs over the Walker River. As such, this species is addressed in the Draft EIS to identify the means of avoidance.|\n|Cultural resources|Commenters raised questions about potential impacts to traditional and cultural Native American resources (including, but not limited to natural resource values encompassing water resources, wildlife, and big game; and other spiritual values), archaeological resources, and historic resources. Tribes also raised questions about whether the Project would impact accessibility to Pistone-Black Mountain National Conservation Area from the site.|\n|Air quality and greenhouse gases/ climate change|Project construction would result in air quality impacts including exhaust emissions as well as dust generation. Commenters raised questions about dust control as well as quantification of potential air quality impacts.|\n|Socioeconomics|Commenters raised questions about potential socioeconomic impacts including impacts to housing demand, including transient housing; economic conditions; property values; community services; and tax revenues.|\n|Environmental justice|The Project region includes low-income, minority, and Native American populations. Commenters raised questions about potential disproportionate and adverse impacts to these populations.|\n|Public health and safety|Commenters raised questions about potential impacts to wildfire risk and disposal of hazardous wastes and wastes such as batteries, transformers, semiconductors, and inverters.|\n|Soils|Commenters raised questions about potential soils impacts from dust and erosion.|\n|Transportation and traffic|Lyon County and a resident raised questions about potential traffic and safety impacts due to increased Project construction traffic on East Walker Road.|\n\n\nJanuary 2024 ES-5\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ES-5 Comparison of Effects \nTable ES - 2 compares the anticipated effects of the Proposed Action and each alternative on the resources\nanalyzed in this Draft EIS.

This Draft EIS analyzes effects\nof and alternatives to the Libra Solar Project (Proposed Action or Project) described in the Plan of\nDevelopment (POD) submitted by Arevia Power, LLC (Applicant) (Arevia 2023). The BLM has prepared\nthis Draft EIS in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (Title 42 of the _United_\n_States Code_ [U.S.C.] 4321 _et seq._ ) and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA\nImplementing Regulations (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500-1508), revised\nas of April 20, 2022. The BLM is the lead agency, authorized through the Federal Land Policy and\nManagement Act of 1976 (FLPMA), as amended.\n\nSection 3104 of the Energy Act of 2020 (codified at 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 3004) directs the Secretary of the Interior\nto issue permits that, in total, authorize production of at least 25 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from wind,\nsolar, and geothermal projects by 2025. Additionally, Executive Order 14082 requires federal agencies to\nprioritize promoting construction of clean energy generation, storage, and transmission, and to enable\ntechnologies through efficient, effective mechanisms that incorporate community engagement.\n\n##### 1.2 Background and Project History\nThe Applicant applied to the BLM\u2019s Carson City District Office (CCDO) for a right-of-way (ROW) grant\nto provide the necessary land and access for the construction and operation of the proposed solar facility\nand interconnection to the regional transmission system. The Project would include up to a 700-megawatt\nalternating current (MWac) solar photovoltaic (PV) power generating facility with an up to 700 MW\nbattery energy storage system (BESS) on approximately 5,141 acres of BLM-managed public land\nlocated to the east of Yerington, Nevada, in Mineral County, immediately adjacent the county line. The\nProject includes a new 24.1-mile-long generation tie-line (gen-tie) extending to the Fort Churchill\nsubstation in Lyon County, of which 22.9 miles would be on BLM-managed lands. The total ROW\nrequested for the solar facility, gen-tie, and access road is 5,778 acres.\n\nThe Project is located within a designated solar variance area under the BLM's 2012 Approved Resource\nManagement Plan Amendments/Record of Decision (ROD) for Solar Energy Development in Six\nSouthwestern States (referred to as the Western Solar Plan herein) (BLM 2012). The BLM completed the\nvariance process for the Project in coordination with appropriate federal, State, and local agencies and\nTribes in December 2021, and conducted the required public outreach. After careful consideration of the\nvariance process requirements, the BLM decided to continue processing the application and proceed with\ninitiation of the NEPA process.\n\nNevada legislation (Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 704.7316) requires utilities to reduce coal-fired\nelectric generation emissions and replace that generation capacity with renewable energy. Additionally,\nNevada\u2019s Renewable Portfolio Standards (N.R.S. 704.7801) currently require 29 percent of renewable\nenergy in 2023; 34 percent in 2024 through 2026; 42 percent in 2027 through 2029; and finally, 50\npercent in 2030 and each year thereafter. New renewable energy facilities must be built to meet these\ngoals and include substantial solar energy facilities, of which the Project is representative. The Project\nwould generate electricity that is cost-competitive with electricity from other types of renewable projects\nand would complement the body of large transmission projects operated by NV Energy. The Fort\nChurchill substation would be the interconnection point for the Project and is also the northern origination\npoint of the segment of the proposed Greenlink West transmission line that terminates at the Harry Allen\nsubstation in Clark County, Nevada.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 1.3 BLM Purpose and Need\nThe need for the action (processing the Applicant\u2019s application) is to respond to the Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a ROW authorization to construct, operate, maintain, and decommission the proposed Project in\naccordance with the BLM\u2019s responsibility under the FLPMA and 43 CFR Part 2800. The need for the\naction is also created by the BLM\u2019s obligation to contribute towards the achievement of the goals\nestablished in Section 3104 of the Energy Act of 2020 and Executive Order 14057 through the\ndevelopment of renewable energy production on federal public land.\n\nThe purpose of the BLM\u2019s action is to determine if the Applicant\u2019s project and alternatives are consistent\nwith relevant laws, regulations, and policies, and to consider whether to grant, grant with modifications,\nor deny the ROW.\n\n##### 1.4 Authorizing Laws, Regulations, Permits, and Guidelines\nApplicable laws, regulations, and policies were considered in the development of the Draft EIS.\nImplementing the Project would also require authorizing actions from other federal, State, and local\nagencies with jurisdiction over certain aspects of the Project, as shown in Table 1.4-1.

The CRMP is a consolidated decision document produced as guidance for BLM land use\ndecisions and management of natural resources within the Carson City District. The BLM reviews\nproposed projects to ensure that a project is in conformance with the CRMP objectives and management\ndirections.\n\nThe BLM has reviewed the Project and has determined that the proposed Project is in conformance with\nthe CRMP, as it meets or exceeds the standard operating procedures (SOPs) listed for each applicable\nresource area and aligns with the CRMP identified desired outcomes. The CRMP SOPs applicable to the\nProject are identified in detail in Appendix B. Conformance is summarized in the following table.\n\n**Table 1.5-1** **Summary of Project Conformance with the 2001 CRMP**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**1.5.2 Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for Solar**\n**Energy Development in Six Southwestern States**\n\nThe BLM and the U.S. Department of Energy released the Final Programmatic Environmental Impact\nStatement for Solar Energy Development (Western Solar Plan) in Six Southwestern States (Arizona,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) in June 2012 (BLM and DOE 2012) and in\nOctober 2012, the Approved Resource Management Plan/ROD was signed (BLM 2012). The Western\nSolar Plan facilitates the permitting of solar energy development projects on federal lands in a more\n\n\n-----\n\nefficient, standardized, and environmentally responsible manner as compared with prior solar energy\npolicies. The Western Solar Plan established locations well suited for utility-scale production of solar\nenergy, known as solar energy zones (SEZs), and also designated variance areas for solar development on\nfederal lands outside of the SEZs but not otherwise excluded by the Western Solar Plan. Variance areas\nare evaluated by the BLM on a case-by-case basis. The Project area is within a variance area and, thus,\nthe Project was subject to the variance approval process. The Project is in conformance with the Western\nSolar Plan.\n\nThe NEPA analysis process includes a review of the Project to ensure it is consistent with and\nincorporates the management prescriptions from the Western Solar Plan, as well as the relevant design\nfeatures identified in the PEIS. An NOI to update the Western Solar Plan was published in the _Federal_\n_Register_ on December 8, 2022 (BLM 2022). The update process is underway, but the existing Western\nSolar Plan prescriptions are currently valid and, thus, analyzed in this Draft EIS.\n\n**1.5.3 Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment Integrated Weed**\n**Management Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact**\n**Statement for Vegetation Treatment Using Herbicides in 17 Western States**\n\nHerbicide applications on federal lands administered by the BLM in the Carson City District are guided\nby the 2015 Integrated Weed Management Plan Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA)\n(BLM 2015). Through established procedures, the final PEA provides a weed treatment framework and\nanalysis for the Carson City District in which site-specific treatments may be authorized. This Draft EIS\nconforms with the PEA, requiring a Pesticide Use Proposal (PUP) prior to any type of herbicide\napplication. The PEA tiers to the 2007 Vegetation Treatments Using Herbicide on Bureau of Land\nManagement Lands in 17 Western States PEIS (BLM 2007).\n\nThis EIS also conforms with the 2007 Vegetation Treatments Using Herbicide on Bureau of Land\nManagement Lands in 17 Western States PEIS (BLM 2007), as well as to the 2016 Final Vegetation\nTreatments Using Aminopyralid, Fluroxypyr, and Rimsulfuron on BLM Lands in 17 Western States PEIS\n(BLM 2016). The 2007 PEIS analyzed the effects from 14 herbicide active ingredients that were\nidentified by the BLM as effective in treating certain types of vegetation while the 2016 PEIS analyzed an\nadditional three herbicide active ingredients. The 2007 and 2016 Final PEIS documents address a wide\nrange of issues, including the effect of these herbicides on the health of humans, vegetation, fish and\nwildlife, livestock, and wild horses and burros. The Final PEISs also consider water quality and Native\nAmerican use of resources, and evaluate the cumulative impacts of herbicide use by the BLM and other\nlandowners. Both Final PEISs include design features that must be adhered to when using the herbicides.\nThe analysis of herbicide uses in this EIS is tiered from the PEA and PEIS.\n\n##### 1.6 Interagency Coordination\n\n**1.6.1 Cooperating Agencies**\nThe CEQ regulations (40 CFR \u00a7 1501.8) emphasize agency cooperation early in the NEPA process and\nallow a lead agency (in this instance, the BLM) to request the assistance of other agencies that have either\njurisdiction by law or special expertise regarding topics considered in an EIS. Said regulations also allow\nan agency to request that the lead agency designate it as a cooperating agency. Cooperating agencies for\nthis Project include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS); the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (USEPA); the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW); Mineral County, Nevada; Lyon County,\nNevada; and the U.S. Department of Defense, Hawthorne Army Depot. See Chapter 4 for more\ninformation on consultation and coordination.\n\n**1.6.2 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service**\nSection 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) requires federal agencies to ensure that\nactions they fund, authorize, permit, or conduct will not jeopardize the continued existence of any\n\n\n-----\n\nfederally listed species or adversely modify designated critical habitats. No federally listed or threatened\nspecies have potential to occur in the Project area of or be affected by the Project and, thus, formal\nconsultation is not expected for the Project.\n\n**1.6.3 State Historic Preservation Office**\nSection 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires that all federal agencies consider\nthe effect of undertakings they conduct, license, approve, or fund on historic properties. The BLM will\ncomply with the Section 106 process under 36 CFR \u00a7 800.8(c), which permits federal agencies to\nintegrate Section 106 and NEPA. The BLM is consulting with the SHPO, and will continue to consult,\nregarding the Draft EIS, consistent with the standards set forth in 36 CFR \u00a7 800.8(c)(1).\n\n##### 1.7 Scoping and Public Involvement \n\n**1.7.1 Overview**\nThe purpose of the scoping process is to identify relevant topics that influence the scope of the Draft EIS,\nincluding alternatives. Internal scoping involves the use of BLM and cooperating agency staff to assist in\ndetermining topics to be analyzed in the NEPA document. External scoping involves notification and\nopportunities for feedback from other agencies, organizations, Tribes, local governments, and the public\nto also determine topics to be analyzed.\n\nThe analysis topics identified during Project scoping are presented in Table 1.7-1. Some topics identified\nduring internal and external scoping did not warrant detailed analysis in the Draft EIS; those topics are\ndescribed in Table 1.7-2. Overall public involvement associated with the Project is summarized in\nChapter 4 of this Draft EIS.\n\n**1.7.2 Internal Scoping**\nInternal scoping was conducted among the BLM interdisciplinary team and cooperating agencies to\nidentify issues prior to public scoping. Interdisciplinary team members with specific expertise provided\nearly input through completion of a Baseline Data Needs Assessment Form to refine the resource areas\nrequiring further analysis and the approach to the environmental analysis.\n\n**1.7.3 External and Public Scoping**\n\n**_1.7.3.1 External Scoping_**\nExternal scoping included meetings with the grazing permit holder, meetings with OHV users, and\nfeedback from interested parties including LADWP, Nevada Copper, and the grazing permit operator.\nTribal outreach was also conducted as part of the external scoping process and included workshops with\nthe Tribes.\n\n**_1.7.3.2 Public Scoping_**\nThe BLM initiated the public scoping process for the Project with the publication of an NOI to prepare an\nEIS for the Project in the _Federal Register_ on April 24, 2023, which initiated a 30-day public scoping\nperiod for the Project that ended on May 24, 2023 (BLM 2023a). BLM also issued a press release\nfollowing the publication of the NOI in the _Federal Register,_ which announced a virtual public scoping\nmeeting for the Project on May 8, 2023. Agencies and stakeholders were notified by postcard of the\npublic scoping meeting opportunity. The meeting was attended by 15 people. Attendees included\nrepresentatives from agencies and organizations as well as private companies, and individuals. The BLM\nreceived 25 emails, letters, or individual verbal comments during the scoping period. A Scoping Report\nwas prepared to summarize the comments received and is available in the Project Record (BLM 2023b).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_1.7.3.3 Issues Identified_**\nThe analysis topics presented in Table 1.7-1 were identified during the public scoping period as well as\nthrough internal BLM interdisciplinary team scoping. Resources analyzed in detail have been identified as\nthose topics that are significant and/or are necessary to make a reasoned choice between alternatives. The\nCEQ guidelines on NEPA (40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1500\u20131508) require agencies to identify and eliminate topics that\nare deemed, from detailed study, not to be subject to an adverse impact. All considerations described in\nTable 1.7-1 have been analyzed in detail within the Draft EIS. Further detail is included in each respective\nresource sub-section within Chapter 3.\n\nOther topics raised during scoping included the development of alternatives to leave vegetation and\nhydrology in place, similar to other recent projects in southern Nevada, and to address cumulative impacts\nfrom the numerous solar and energy projects proposed in the region and throughout Nevada. Alternatives\nand cumulative impacts are analyzed in detail in this Draft EIS.\n\nTable 1.7-2 discusses the resource topics that are addressed but not analyzed in detail in the Draft EIS.\n\n**Table 1.7-1** **Resource Topics Analyzed in Detail**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Table 1.7-2** **Topics Not Further Analyzed in the EIS**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Resource topic|Rationale for dismissal from detailed analysis|\n|---|---|\n|Wild horses and burros|The Project area is not within any herd management areas. The Wassuk herd is located to the south. Impacts to wild horses and burros management would not occur.|\n|Acoustics|No sensitive noise receptors (e.g., residences) are located within 5.5 miles of the solar site. Acoustic impacts to humans would not occur. Impacts to wildlife from noise would be temporary and would not result in long-term disturbance or avoidance; however, these noise-related impacts are addressed under biological topics.|\n|Paleontology|Based on the geological resources underlying the site, impacts to paleontological resources are not anticipated.|\n|Wilderness|No wilderness areas nor wilderness study areas nor areas with wilderness characteristics are in the Project area, and wilderness areas would not be impacted by the Proposed Action or the alternatives.|\n|Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC)|There are no ACECs in the Project vicinity.|\n|Farmlands|No soils designated as prime or unique farmlands are located within the solar site. Some areas of prime or unique farmlands are located along the gen-tie; however, the limited disturbance footprint of the gen-tie of approximately 104 acres distributed over 24.1 miles (or approximately 4.3 acres per mile) would result in minimal, temporary impacts, and thus, impacts would not be adverse. Neither the Proposed Action nor the alternatives would impact soils as to irreversibly convert farmlands to nonagricultural use.|\n|Wild and scenic rivers|There are no designated/eligible/suitable wild and scenic rivers within the Project vicinity.|\n|Cave and karst resources|There are no cave or karst areas within the Project site.|\n|Trails and travel management|No Travel Management Plans or designated trails are located within the Project area.|\n|Woodland or forestry|No woodland or forestry products are in the Project area. Cacti are addressed under vegetation and sensitive plant species.|\n\n\n-----\n\n### Chapter 2 Proposed Action and Action Alternatives\n\n##### 2.1 Introduction\n\n**2.1.1 Right-of-Way Application and Proposed Action**\nLibra Solar, LLC, filed an application to construct, own, operate, and decommission the Project,\nconsisting of a 700 MWac solar PV power generating facility and 700 MW BESS, a gen-tie, and an\naccess road within a ROW of approximately 5,778 acres of BLM-administered land located in Mineral\nand Lyon counties, Nevada. The Project would be constructed using PV solar modules mounted on\nsingle-axis, horizontal tracker structures combined with an integrated BESS. The power produced by the\nProject would be conveyed to the NV Energy transmission system via interconnection with the NV\nEnergy grid at the Fort Churchill substation.\n\nThe Project as presented in the ROW application POD is considered the Proposed Action in this Draft\nEIS. The Project solar site is in Mineral County, Nevada, approximately 55 miles southeast of the Reno\nmetropolitan area and 11 miles southeast of the town of Yerington. U.S. Route 95 (US 95) is 7 miles east\nof the solar site and State Route 208 (SR 208) is 8 miles west. The gen-tie line and access road would\nextend into Lyon County. The regional context of the Project area is shown in Figure 2.1-1 and Figure\n2.1-2. Figure 2.1-3 includes the solar development areas within the solar site and the Project elements that\ncomprise the Proposed Action.\n\n**2.1.2 Development of Action Alternatives**\nIn accordance with the CEQ's NEPA Regulations (40 CFR \u00a7 1502.14), an EIS must present the\nenvironmental impacts of a Proposed Action and alternatives in comparative form. The EIS must define\nthe issues to be readily understood by the public and decision makers, thus contributing to a basis for an\ninformed and reasoned decision.\n\nReasonable alternatives to the Proposed Action were developed by the BLM to avoid or reduce resource\nconflicts and meet the purpose and need, in accordance with the BLM NEPA Handbook \u00a76.6.1. Three\nalternatives to the Proposed Action were selected for detailed analysis in the Draft EIS. Details on the\ndevelopment of the alternatives to the Proposed Action and their impacts are provided in the _Alternatives_\n_Report_ (Panorama 2023), which includes descriptions of other alternatives considered but eliminated from\nfurther analysis.\n\nThe following section describes the Project as it would be implemented under the Proposed Action. Three\nalternatives (Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and Alternative 3) were developed in response to issues raised\nby the public and agencies (see the _Scoping Report for the Libra Solar Project_ (BLM 2023c)). Alternative\n1, as described in Section 2.4, proposes the use of specific construction methods that would reduce\nimpacts to vegetation, drainage, and topography. Alternative 2, as described in Section 2.5, is focused on\nreducing impacts associated with the Project\u2019s access road during construction. Alternative 3, described in\nSection 2.6, would reduce many of the impacts associated with the gen-tie, but the feasibility of this\nalternative remains uncertain and would depend on the approval and construction of the proposed\nGreenlink West Transmission Project, which is currently undergoing NEPA review (BLM 2023b).\nAlternative 3 is fully analyzed in this Draft EIS, but is not the preferred alternative due to its dependence\non a currently unapproved project. Several other alternatives were identified and considered, but were\neliminated from detailed analysis. Section 2.8 identifies these alternatives and provides the rationale for\neliminating them from detailed analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.1-1** **Regional Context of the Proposed Project**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.1-2** **Proposed Project Location**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.1-3** **Proposed Solar Site Facilities**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2.2 Proposed Action \n\n**2.2.1 Overview**\nThe Proposed Action includes obtaining a ROW for and the construction, operation and maintenance\n(O&M), and decommissioning of the Project. The Project includes the following primary components: 1)\na 700 MWac solar PV power generating facility; 2) a 700 MW BESS; 3) linear and ancillary facilities,\nincluding access roads, electrical distribution lines, and communication cables; 4) O&M facilities; and 5)\na substation and a 24.1-mile-long 345 kilovolt (kV) or 525 kV gen-tie line into the Fort Churchill substation,\nof which 22.9 miles would be on the BLM-managed lands.\n\n**2.2.2 Proposed Action Project Components**\n\n**_2.2.2.1 Overview_**\nThis section provides a summary of the Proposed Action. A detailed explanation of each component and\nits corresponding construction requirements is provided in the Draft Libra Solar Project POD, dated\nNovember 2023, which is incorporated by reference.\n\nThe Project includes the solar site ROW (5,141 acres) and a gen-tie ROW including gen-tie access (603\nacres). A ROW would also be established along an existing access road to the solar site, which comprises\n34 acres along 11.6 miles on the BLM lands. The total acreage requested for the ROW is 5,778 acres\nunder the Proposed Action. The Project would interconnect with the NV Energy transmission grid at the\nFort Churchill substation in Lyon County.\n\n**_2.2.2.2 Solar PV Modules/Array_**\nThe Project would be a solar PV power generating facility. PV modules convert sunlight into direct\ncurrent (DC) electricity that would be collected and converted to alternating current (AC) electricity\nthough a system of inverters. Medium-voltage transformers would convert the AC electricity to 34.5 kV\nthen transfer the energy to the on-site substation, where it would then be converted and transferred. The\nelectricity would be stepped up with high-voltage transformer(s) to 345 kV or 525 kV and then delivered\nto the Fort Churchill substation (also known as the point of interconnection [POI]) via a new 345 kV or\n525 kV gen-tie line (see Figure 2.1-2, page 2-3, above).\n\nThe highest point for a horizontal tracker would be achieved during the morning and evening hours, when\nthe trackers are tilted at their maximum angle and would be a maximum of 12 feet above the ground\nsurface, depending on the grade where the posts are installed. Panels would be mounted on single-axis\ntrackers in north\u2013south oriented rows. Spacing between rows would be set in the final design but would\nallow for clearance for maintenance vehicles and panel access.\n\nAn above-ground or under-ground DC electrical collection system would connect each solar array to a\npower conversion station (PCS), which would include an inverter that converts DC power to AC power, a\nmedium-voltage transformer that steps up the voltage to 34.5 kV, and other controls/data equipment. The\nProject could include solar arrays of 2 MWac or more. Inverters may be installed on raised platforms to\nminimize ground disturbance and hydrologic alterations, if determined feasible during final design. An\nAC electrical collection system would be installed above ground or underground within the solar array\nblocks to deliver the energy from the PCSs to the solar site substation. Collection line poles may be steel\nor wood and could have multiple circuits on poles with insulating conductors.\n\nCurrent PV technology could generate 1 MW of electricity per 6 to 9 acres of land suitable for\nconstruction of PV arrays and associated facilities. However, PV technology is rapidly improving, and the\npotential MW/acre may increase prior to the start of Project construction. For purposes of this Draft EIS,\na 700 MW project is assumed. The exact final Project output may be higher or lower depending on the\nprocured panel technology.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_2.2.2.3 Battery Energy Storage System_**\nThe Project would include a BESS of up to 700 MWdc. Approximately 392 equipment areas, each with\napproximately 23 to 25 380 MWdc, 3.7-hour storage-duration battery racks, would be built. The entire\nBESS would comprise approximately 72,000 individual batteries (8 batteries per battery rack). Lithium\niron phosphate batteries may be used (otherwise, the best technology at the time of construction would be\nused) and would undergo thermal propagation tests and comply with the latest codes and standards. The\nbattery racks would be installed adjacent to the AC/DC power converter and PCS on either a foundation\nor pilings as needed to protect the racks from stormwater runoff. The battery racks may be enclosed in\nmultiple, dispersed climate-controlled structures approximately 5 feet long by 5 feet wide by 8 feet tall.\nAlternatively, battery racks may be stored in enclosures in a single designated fenced and cleared area of\nthe solar site, near the on-site collector substation, which would occupy approximately 35 acres. The\nbattery energy storage system could be constructed on a raised platform. The feasibility of raising the\nstructures would be determined at final design.\n\n**_2.2.2.4 Linear and Ancillary Facilities Associated with the Solar Site_**\n\n**Fencing**\nThe entire solar site would be fenced to restrict public access during construction and O&M. The fencing\nwould be outside of major routes through the development area, including Reese River Road and Old\nState Road 2C, such that the public could continue to use these roads. The height of the perimeter fencing\nwould be approximately 6 to 7 feet and may be chain-link or another design. The fence may include\nbarbed wire on the top. The on-site substation would be fenced as well. The fence posts would be set in\nconcrete or driven into the ground. Controlled access gates would be located at all entrances to the\nfacility. Fencing would be grounded per industry standards.\n\nThe perimeter fencing would include design elements to ensure permeability by small animals, which\ncould include 12 inch by 12 inch openings in the lower section of the fencing every 0.25 miles or\ninstalling an approximately 8 to 12 inch gap at the base of the fence, as shown in Figure 2.2-1, for the\nlength of the fence. The final fence design would be determined in coordination with the BLM and\nconsidering feedback from the resource agencies.\n\n**Internal Road System**\nWithin the fenced solar site, a roadway system for the development and maintenance of the solar arrays\nand equipment would be developed consisting of an internal grid and perimeter roadways, graded, and\ncovered in aggregate (6 inches in depth) or compacted soil (12 inches of recompacted native material).\nApproximately 34 miles of internal access roads would be installed. The internal access road system for\nthe Proposed Action is shown in Figure 2.1-3. Existing roads within the solar site would also be utilized\nand maintained as part of the internal access system.\n\n**Drainage Systems**\nThe solar field would include drainage control structures, including linear ditches, swales, and retention\nbasins, as shown in Figure 2.1-3. The drainage systems would be within the fenced solar field and would\ncollect and move water away from facilities and slow the downstream flows. The Project would include\napproximately 21 acres of swales and ditches and 45 acres of retention basins.\n\n**Meteorological Stations and Microwave Stations**\nTemporary and permanent meteorological stations would be installed within and around the perimeter of\nthe solar site. Communication service to the Project would be provided by local service providers and/or a\nmicrowave tower and wireless system that would collect and send data to the supervisory control and data\nacquisition system (SCADA). The Project would include on-site communication lines connecting the\nProject components.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.2-1** **Example of Small Mammal Permeable Fencing**\n\n**Existing Distribution Line Reroute**\nAn existing electrical distribution line (NVN-093397) that leads to a decommissioned communications\ntower, located to the east of the Project area in the Wassuk Range, would need to be re-routed through the\nsolar site. The existing electrical distribution line would be re-routed along Old State Road 2C, which\nwould remain open through the Project area, and then would connect back to the existing line at the\nProject\u2019s eastern boundary or through an opening between solar array blocks. The re-route would occur\nwithin the proposed ROW for the Project. This distribution system would also be utilized to provide\npower to the O&M facilities. The Applicant would undertake a permitting process with NV Energy to\nboth re-route the distribution line and adjust its ROW application with the BLM, and to re-energize the\nline to the point of connection to the solar construction facilities (Panorama Environmental, Inc. 2023).\n\n**_2.2.2.5 Solar Field Access Road_**\nAccess for the Project during both construction and O&M would be off State Route (SR) 208 to East\nWalker Road, connecting to Reese River Road and Old State Road 2C. East Walker Road is an unpaved\npublic roadway maintained by Lyon County. Approximately 2.3 miles of East Walker Road is on Countymanaged lands while the remaining 3.6 miles is on the BLM-managed lands. The initial 1.5 miles of East\nWalker Road to SR 208, heading east, may be paved with traffic-calming measures installed, the design\nof which would be determined in coordination with Lyon County Roads Department. A new 900-footlong, 24-foot-wide road spur would be constructed between East Walker Road and Reese River Road, on\nthe BLM-managed lands, to smooth a curve in the road at the existing intersection. Reese River Road\nwould then be utilized to access the solar site and would be widened from 15 feet to 24 feet as would a\nportion of Old State Road 2C, for a total of 7.8 miles of widening.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccess would remain open through the solar site along Reese River Road and Old State Road 2C, as\npreviously stated. In addition to widening, improvements to Reese River Road and Old State Road 2C\nwould include some permanent upgrades to facilitate the use of heavy equipment, including laying of\ngravel substrate and creation of low-water crossings. The access road would also require stabilization of\nlow-water crossings, which may include installation of cut-off walls to reduce the impact to the road\nsurface during high water flows.\n\n**_2.2.2.6 Operations and Maintenance Facilities_**\n\n**O&M Building**\nThe Project would include a 2.8-acre O&M facility that would accommodate an O&M building, a paved\nparking area, and other associated facilities such as above-ground water storage tanks, a septic system,\nsecurity fencing, signage, lighting, and, potentially, flagpoles. The O&M building would either utilize\nportable toilets or have an on-site septic system designed per County standards. Portable toilets and\nwashing stations would be serviced by a contracted company, if used. Other facilities, such as a\nwarehouse for materials storage, may be constructed within the O&M area footprint. Plant auxiliary\nsystems would be designed to control, protect, and support O&M activities. These systems include the\nlighting system and the fire protection system. The solar site would be monitored 24 hours per day, seven\ndays per week during O&M.\n\n**Lighting System**\nPermanent outdoor night lighting would be provided at the administration/O&M building and on-site\nsubstation; however, some portable lighting may be required for some maintenance activities that must be\nperformed at night. Lighting would be kept to the minimum required for safety and security. Sensors,\nswitches, and timers would be used to keep lighting turned off when not required, and all lights would be\nhooded and directed downwards so as to minimize backscatter and off-site light.\n\n**Fire Protection**\nThe Project\u2019s fire-protection water system would be supplied from a water storage tank, with sizing and\ndesign of the facilities determined in the final design phase in coordination with the Mineral County Fire\nDepartment. The BLM and local emergency services would have emergency access to the solar site via a\nlocked gate to facilitate response time for wildfire and non-wildfire incidents. A Fire Management Plan\nwould be implemented to reduce fire risk to the solar site and surrounding public lands for the life of the\nProject. If required by the fire department, a perimeter fire road may also be installed.\n\n**_2.2.2.7 Substation and Gen-tie_**\n\n**Substation**\nThe Project would require an on-site 345 kV or 525 kV substation, which would be 8.3 acres in size. The\nsubstation would be constructed to comply with applicable electrical safety codes. The substation would\nbe separately fenced to provide increased security around the medium- and high-voltage electrical\nequipment. The substation area would include a transformer containment area, a microwave tower, a\ncontrol house, and one or more transformers. The height of components in the substation varies, with the\nmaximum highest being the gen-tie pole, at 180 feet. The on-site substation would be a series of 34.5 kV\nbreakers for collection of power from the solar modules via the electrical collection system, a common\nbusbar, and a step-up transformer.\n\n**Gen-tie**\nThe Project would require the construction of an approximately 24.1-mile 345 kV or 525 kV circuit and\nfiber optic data telecommunications system for interconnection to the utility transmission grid system at\nthe existing Fort Churchill substation. Approximately 22.9 miles of the 24.1-mile gen-tie alignment\nwould be on the BLM-managed lands, with most of the alignment within an existing designated energy\ncorridor, with two exceptions. The proposed gen-tie alignment deviates from the designated energy\ncorridor along a 4-mile section where the energy corridor overlaps with the Mason Valley Wildlife\nManagement Area (WMA). The gen-tie alignment also deviates from the designated energy corridor\n\n\n-----\n\nwhere it exits the solar site to the north, for the first approximately 4.4 miles. This realignment was\nestablished because the energy corridor passes through mapped habitat for the Bi-State sage grouse, while\nthe realigned route does not. The gen-tie ROW width would be approximately 200 feet. Where adjacent,\nthe gen-tie would be constructed outside the ROW of the proposed NV Energy Greenlink West 525 kV\nline, with an appropriate buffer. The Project would require approximately 190 gen-tie poles, most likely\nH-frame structures, cleared out up to 30 feet around each pole base.\n\nThe overhead line and fiber optic data telecommunications system would be installed per local and\nnational electrical code requirements and in tandem with the gen-tie alignment. Support structures would\nbe galvanized steel monopoles or H-frames, with a dull gray appearance and would be used to support\ninterconnection to the NV Energy transmission system. A point of change of ownership (POCO) would\nbe established with NV Energy, from which the remaining line extending to the Fort Churchill substation\nwould be owned by NV Energy. All overhead electrical lines would be designed and installed in\naccordance with the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee\u2019s (APLIC's) Suggested Practices for Avian\nProtection on Power Lines (APLIC 2006).The Applicant also would prepare and adhere to a Bird and Bat\nConservation Strategy (BBCS) to address potential impacts to birds and bats during the construction and\nO&M phases of the Project.\n\n**Gen-tie Access Roads**\nExisting or planned roads that are approximately 20 feet wide would be used for primary access to the\ngen-tie line. Spur roads would be constructed off the existing roads to allow access to each gen-tie\nstructure. Approximately 16.9 miles of 20-foot-wide spur roads would be constructed, and approximately\n18.1 miles of existing (or proposed for Greenlink West) unpaved, 15-foot-wide access roads would be\nused without improvements. Another 17 miles of 15-foot-wide existing access roads would require\nimprovements. The existing and new spur roads needed for the gen-tie alignment are shown in the POD.\n\n**_2.2.2.8 Proposed Action Summary of Permanent Disturbance_**\nPermanent disturbance is associated with all long-term Project components and associated facilities\nthroughout the 30-year lifespan of the Project, including the solar arrays, BESS, roads and access routes,\npower distribution equipment, substations, gen-tie and transmission infrastructure, and permanent\nfencing. These areas would not be reclaimed until the end-of-life of the Project, which would occur in\naccordance with the BLM-approved Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan.\n\nTable 2.2-1 summarizes anticipated permanent disturbance associated with the Proposed Action. The table\nalso summarizes the temporary disturbance associated with construction, as described in Section 2.2.3.\n\n**2.2.3 Proposed Action Construction**\n\n**_2.2.3.1 Construction Facilities and Temporary Disturbance_**\nTemporary facilities would be installed for the facilitation of construction and would not become part of\nthe permanent facility. Temporary disturbance areas would be restored in accordance with the BLMapproved Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan following the completion of primary construction\nactivities. These facilities include the following (all values are approximate):\n\n-  An approximately 3-acre office complex made up of a gravel base and trailers,\n\n-  1 acre of nurseries for salvaged cacti,\n\n-  80 acres of material storage and laydown yards, including for worker vehicle parking,\n\n-  82 acres of gen-tie structure work areas comprising 75-foot-by-50-foot areas per pole, and\n\n-  18 acres of gen-tie pull and tension sites comprising 100-foot-by-200-foot pull and tension\n\nsites.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 2.2-1** **Summary of Estimated Permanent and Temporary Disturbance for the Proposed Action**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Disturbance type or area|Temporary or permanent|Acres of disturbance on the BLM land|Acres of disturbance total|Notes|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Solar facility|||||\n|Solar array blocks|Permanent|3,062|3,062|Solar panels, posts, and other associated equipment would be installed within this graded area.

Temporary disturbance acreages may overlap with permanent disturbance acreages.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_2.2.3.2 Construction Sequencing_**\nConstruction of the Project under the Proposed Action and alternatives would follow the sequencing described\nbelow:\n\n-  **Geotechnical investigation:** Prior to construction and after the BLM approval, a detailed\n\ngeotechnical investigation of the Project area would be necessary to finalize engineering\nspecifications.\n\n-  **Temporary storage and laydown yards:** Temporary staging areas would be established to\n\nfacilitate construction activities and mobilize equipment and materials. Temporary storage and\nlaydown yards would be prepared during the onset of construction. These areas would be placed\noutside of the channels of drainages.\n\n-  **Site preparation:** Site preparation would include land-surveying and site delineation; trenching\n\nand excavation; and dust, erosion, and sediment control. Incised drainages would be left in place\nand largely unaltered; land contours would be maintained although drainage would be controlled\nusing retention basins, affecting site hydrology after construction; any saleable mineral materials\nwould likely be balanced in the Project area (i.e., any saleable minerals extracted from within the\nROW would be used within the ROW for construction); should any excess saleable mineral\nmaterials be generated during construction, the materials would be disposed of and exported from\nthe Project area through a BLM Contract for the Sale of Mineral Materials or Free Use Permit or\notherwise stockpiled within the ROW or another mineral mining site for future disposal by the\nBLM. The site preparation would also follow a Signage and Flagging Plan, which would be\nreviewed and approved by the BLM prior to construction.\n\n-  **Solar array assembly:** Solar array assembly would include mobilization of material and\n\nequipment to individual solar array block areas; preparation of trenches, installation of\nunderground cable, and backfill of trenches; installation of posts and table frames for the tracking\nsystem; installation of PV modules; connection of electrical terminations; and inspection, testing,\nand commissioning equipment.\n\n-  **Construction of electrical collection and transmission systems:** The electrical collection and\n\ntransmission-system infrastructure would entail the installation of the direct-current powerconversion stations and SCADA systems; the power and control equipment; the high-, medium-,\nand low-voltage cables; grounding of all equipment; and installation of communication systems.\n\n-  **Construction of on-site substation:** An 8.3-acre on-site substation, including a transformer\n\ncontainment area, a microwave tower, a control house, and one or more transformers, would be\nconstructed on site. The transformer containment area would be lined with an impermeable\nmembrane covered with gravel. The remaining substation area would be constructed with\nexcavation and pouring of a foundation, as well as installation of electrical equipment and\noverhead cabling, installation of a control building, and installation of all auxiliary systems (e.g.,\nheating, ventilation, lights).\n\n-  **Construction of auxiliary systems and infrastructure:** Internal roadways and transmission\n\naccess would be constructed through grading, compacting, and leveling. Construction of auxiliary\nsystems and infrastructure, including internal access roads, the O&M facilities, lighting, fencing,\nfire protection system, and water storage and delivery system would be constructed.\n\n**_2.2.3.3 Construction Water Use, Waste, and Power_**\nAn estimated 1,000 acre-feet of water would be required during the Project construction period for constructionrelated activities, including dust control. The primary waste generated at the Project during construction and\nO&M would be non-hazardous solid and liquid wastes. Limited quantities of hazardous materials would be used\nand stored on site, and some waste would be generated. All waste, including batteries, would be properly\ndisposed of, or recycled in accordance with regulations and a Waste and Hazardous Materials Management Plan\nas well as a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan (SPCCP). Spent lithium-ion batteries would be\nrecycled if a battery cannot be recycled due to damage or other issues, the battery would be disposed of at an\nappropriate facility. The types and quantities of hazardous materials and wastes are provided in the POD. Power\n\n\n-----\n\nwould be supplied through an existing distribution line that would be energized through agreements with NV\nEnergy.\n\n**_2.2.3.4 Construction Method, Workforce, Equipment, and Schedule_**\nConstruction activities would occur between 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. up to 7 days per week. The on-site\nconstruction workforce would consist of laborers, craftsmen, supervisory personnel, support personnel, and\nconstruction management personnel. The on-site construction workforce is anticipated to be an average of\napproximately 400 construction workers with a peak of up to approximately 700 workers, assuming some\nperiods of construction would minimize the workforce while others would be more workforce reliant. For\nexample, the geotechnical investigation would require as little as up to five personnel for a time period of up to\none month. The site preparation, solar array assembly, the construction of electrical collection and transmission\nsystems, construction of on-site substation, and the construction of auxiliary systems and infrastructure would\noverlap for a period of six months from February to July 2025, where the peak of 700 workers would be\nanticipated (refer to Table 2.2-3). Most construction staff and workers would commute daily to the job site from\nthe Reno and Carson City metropolitan areas, but up to 10 percent of the workforce may be drawn from within\nMineral County, from the city of Yerington, and other areas of Lyon County. Anticipated construction traffic\nvolume is provided in Table 2.2-2. A Traffic Management Plan would be prepared prior to construction for\nreview by the BLM.\n\n**Table 2.2-2** **Construction Vehicle Daily Roundtrips**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Construction phase|Daily worker vehicle trips|Daily haul truck trips|Daily water truck trips|Daily pickup truck trips|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Civil works|78|47|40|5|\n|Installation of solar arrays|183|15|40|5|\n|Installation of electrical collection systems|85|4|20|5|\n|Installation of on-site collector substation|38|6|20|5|\n|Civil works gen-tie|78|47|20|5|\n|Installation of gen-tie|80|4|20|5|\n\n\nTypical equipment that would be used for the generation facilities and on-site substation includes the following:\n\n-  Tractors -  Disk/tillers -  Vibratory rollers\n\n-  Excavators -  Dump trucks -  Pumps\n\n-  Graders -  Trenching machines -  Forklifts and carry decks\n\n-  Excavators -  Pile drivers -  Electrical test equipment\n\n-  Bulldozers -  Flatbed trucks -  Concrete mixers\n\n-  Backhoes -  Cranes -  Compaction machines\n\n-  Cutting machines -  Rollers -  Survey equipment\n\n-  End loaders -  Water supply trucks -  Off-road buggies\n\n-  Delivery trucks -  Water spray trucks -  Light trucks\n\nThe Project construction schedule would be phased over 16 months. Commencement of construction on a\nportion of the site could occur in December 2024, with the Project coming online in May 2026. The estimated\nconstruction schedule is provided in Table 2.2-3.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 2.2-3** **Estimated Construction Schedule**\n\n|Activity|Duration|Timeframe|\n|---|---|---|\n|Site preparation (Project solar site)|8 months|December 2024 to July 2025|\n|Site preparation (Project access roads)|2 months|January 2025 to March 2025|\n|Installation of PV arrays|14 months|February 2025 to March 2026|\n|Installation of electrical collection systems|11 months|February 2025 to March 2026|\n|Installation of on-site collection substation|11 months|December 2024 to November 2025|\n|Installation of gen-tie line|11 months|December 2024 to November 2025|\n|Testing and commissioning|Ongoing|March 2026 to April 2026|\n|Site reclamation|Ongoing|No later than June 2026|\n\n\n\n**2.2.4 Proposed Action Operation and Maintenance**\nOperation of the Project would create 15 permanent jobs (Triple Point Strategic Consulting, 2022). The solar\npower plant would be operated remotely 7 days per week using automated facility controls and monitoring\nsystems with SCADA control systems. Operations staff would be located off site, with daily site visits for\nsecurity, routine inspection and maintenance, and repairs. At designated intervals, approximately every 10 to 15\nyears, major equipment maintenance would be performed. O&M procedures would be consistent with industry\nstandards and practices for maintaining plant components for as long as acceptable so as to reduce waste. Solar\npanels would be recycled in accordance with the EPAs recommendations for recycling of utility-scale solar\npanels. The Applicant and facility operator would be responsible for identifying and managing the recycling and\ndisposal of all Project components in accordance with the appropriate State and federal solar recycling programs\navailable at the time.\n\nRoutine inspection and maintenance activities are listed along with frequencies for each in the POD. PV panel\ncleaning would occur as needed to maintain optimal power-generation performance. PV array cleaning may\noccur approximately two times per year and could take approximately 24 hours to complete (including nighttime\npanel cleaning) and may require some use of water. The Project would require up to 28 acre-feet of water per\nyear for O&M facility purposes (e.g., worker subsistence, sanitation, fire protection, PV array cleaning). Project\nroads and the O&M area would be maintained free of vegetation.\n\nVegetation management would be required to control vegetation and prevent the spread of undesirable nonnative and noxious weeds. Vegetation management would occur through mechanical methods (i.e., discing) and\nthe BLM-approved chemical controls (i.e., herbicides). The use of herbicides would fall under the 2015 Final\nPEA Integrated Weed Management Plan (BLM 2015); tiered from the 2016 Plan for the BLM\u2019s Vegetation\nTreatments Using Aminopyralid, Fluroxypyr, and Rimsulfuron on BLM Lands in 17 Western States (BLM\n2016), which is tiered from the 2007 PEIS for Vegetation Treatments Using Herbicides on Bureau of Land\nManagement Lands in 17 Western States (BLM 2007). A PUP would be prepared 30 days prior to application\nand would provide the specifications for herbicide application, including the type of herbicide(s) proposed for\nuse, method of application, and quantities of to be applied. Following application, a Pesticide Application\nRecord (PAR) would be submitted to the BLM 24 hours post application. Only herbicides and application\nmethods and quantities approved in Nevada and the Carson City District and included in the RODs for the\nPEISs would be used. Herbicide use would be conducted in accordance with BLM Manual 9011: Chemical Pest\nControl and the BLM Handbook H-9011-1: Chemical Pest Control (BLM 1988). SOPs for herbicide use would\nbe implemented.\n\nThe Applicant would implement a Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan and an Integrated Weed Management\nPlan that specify procedures, including use of herbicides for managing vegetation and reducing the spread of\nnon-native and noxious weeds. The plans would be submitted to the BLM for review and approval prior to the\nissuance of a Notice to Proceed (NTP), should the Project be approved.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.2.5 Proposed Action Decommissioning and Site Reclamation**\nThe objective of Project decommissioning and reclamation is to remove the installed power generation\nequipment and to encourage revegetation of native species, as feasible. The Applicant would be required to post\na reclamation bond as a condition of the ROW authorization issuance in order to ensure the availability of funds\nfor site decommission and reclamation. The Project\u2019s bond would be based on the approved Decommissioning\nand Site Reclamation Plan. The plan will be finalized based on the selected Alternative prior to issuance of NTP.\nThe life of the Project would be approximately 30 years. While it is possible that the Project is repowered at the\nend of the 30-year period, for the purposes of the Draft EIS, decommissioning has been analyzed in Chapter 3\nfor all resources. Prior to termination of the 30-year ROW grant, the Applicant would update the site-specific\nDecommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan.\n\nThe Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan would provide details regarding the removal of all Project\ncomponents, reuse of materials to the extent feasible, and site restoration activities to a percentage of reference\nsite conditions. The Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan would discuss all currently applicable laws,\nordinances, regulations, and standards associated with the reuse, safe storage, or disposal of Project materials.\nThe plan would also include a description of procedures for removal, groundwater required for removal, and for\nnotification of regulatory agencies. Decommissioning requires approximately one-third of the workforce, time,\nand resources as construction of the Project; therefore, it would be expected to occur over six months and\nrequire the support of approximately 150 workers on average. Similarly, water use is estimated to require onethird the amount of construction or 335 acre-feet. The BLM would review the plan prior to approval.\n\n##### 2.3 No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action alternative, the BLM would not authorize a ROW grant for the Project. No solar site,\nsubstation, gen-tie line, O&M facilities, or other Project components would be constructed. The BLM would\ncontinue to manage the land consistent with the CRMP (BLM 2001), as amended. Any future applications for\nsolar development of the site would be subject to the site-specific conditions identified in the BLM\u2019s Western\nSolar Plan (BLM and DOE 2012), or as updated, and the applicable laws and land use plans in place at the time\nof application.\n\n##### 2.4 Alternative 1: Major Drainage Avoidance, Fenced Corridors, and Vegetation and Topography Maintenance\n\n**2.4.1 Overview**\nAlternative 1 (Major Drainage Avoidance, Fenced Corridors, and Vegetation and Topography Maintenance) is\ndesigned as a Project lifespan alternative; it would modify elements of the Proposed Action throughout\nconstruction, O&M, and decommissioning. The intent of Alternative 1 is to reduce disturbance to major washes,\nvegetation, and soils within the solar site by locating development areas outside of the major washes and\nproviding guidelines to limit vegetation disturbance during construction. Restoration would be conducted over\nthe lifespan of the Project through development and implementation of a Site Restoration and Revegetation\nPlan. Reducing disturbance would help to preserve soils, soil seed banks, native perennial vegetation, wildlife\nhabitat, and sensitive plant species, as well as reduce the potential for the introduction of invasive weeds,\nfugitive dust, and erosion from increased stormwater runoff volumes and velocities. Alternative 1 is also\ndesigned to simplify the reclamation of the Project site at the Project's end-of-life.\n\n**2.4.2 Elements the Same as the Proposed Action**\nAll of the Project's solar site components (i.e., solar array blocks, BESS, linear and ancillary facilities, water\nretention facilities, O&M facilities, and on-site substation) would be largely the same as for the Proposed\nAction, with the same energy production and storage capacity. The gen-tie line and access roads would also be\nthe same as for the Proposed Action.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.4.3 Elements Unique to Alternative 1**\n\n**_2.4.3.1 Project Design_**\n\n**Development Blocks**\nUnder Alternative 1, Project development in the solar site would be limited to seven defined \"development\nblocks\" to avoid major washes (i.e., where modeled flows could exceed 3 feet in 100-year storm events) and key\naccess routes. Acreages of the seven development blocks are shown in Table 2.4-1. The balance of the 5,141acre application area, comprising 707 acres, would be outside of fenced areas under this alternative. Figure 2.4-1\nalso shows how the site would be divided into development blocks under Alternative 1. The minimum setback\nfor solar arrays is outside the 100-year flood plain of the large washes, as well as major roadways that would\nremain open. Alternative 1 would also create permeability through the Project solar site for movement of\nrecreationalists and wildlife, including game species. A more detailed site plan for Alternative 1 is shown in the\n_Alternatives Report_ , available with the Draft EIS on the BLM\u2019s National BLM NEPA Register website.\n\n**Table 2.4-1** **Acreages of Development Blocks under Alternative 1**\n\n|Development block|Area (acres)|\n|---|---|\n|A|3,000|\n|B|317|\n|C|469|\n|D|225|\n|E|71|\n|F|259|\n|G|93|\n|Total|4,434|\n\n\n\n**Vegetation and Topography Maintenance**\nAlternative 1 includes several thresholds of disturbance for each type of construction method to be used within\nthe solar array areas. The thresholds do not apply to areas of permanent disturbance, such as equipment pads,\nbuildings, driveways, conduit channels, internal access roads within the solar array development blocks, or\ndetention basins. Under Alternative 1, overland travel methods would be utilized to develop the solar array\nblocks, so as to reduce disturbance to topography, soils, and vegetation and vegetation root systems. Methods\nwould include both overland travel that maintains vegetation and overland travel that crushes vegetation but\naims to preserve the root ball. The methods allow for some grading in the solar array development blocks. The\nthresholds are as follows:\n\n-  **Grading:** Traditional construction methods (i.e., disc and roll and grading) would be allowed for\n\nadjustments to topography or to construct around other constraints more easily. Within the solar\narray blocks, a maximum disturbance guideline for grading for panel installation is established at\napproximately 20 percent.\n\n-  **Overland travel/maintain vegetation:** Approximately 40 percent of the existing remaining\n\nperennial vegetation within each solar array block (not including areas for\nequipment pads, access roads, conduits, detention basins, etc.) would be preserved through limited\noverland travel and avoidance. During final design, the Applicant would need to demonstrate to\nthe BLM that this goal is feasible through selected construction methods.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.4-1** **Proposed Development Blocks under Alternative 1**\n\n\n-----\n\n-  **Overland travel/crushed vegetation:** The remaining 40 percent of the solar array blocks (not\n\nincluding areas for equipment pads, access roads, conduits, detention basins, etc.) would be\nconstructed using overland travel, with the vegetation crushed over successive equipment passes.\nThe number of passes would be limited to the minimum needed to construct the features, with the\ngoal of maintaining root balls so that portions of these areas could later be restored.\n\n-  **Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan:** Alternative 1 also includes restoration over the lifespan\nof the Project to maintain the perennial vegetation cover and to restore vegetation that was subject\nto drive and crush within the solar array block area. The Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan\nwould also dictate maintenance of the vegetation for fire and operational safety over the lifespan\nof the Project. The Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan would identify the methods selected,\nincluding the seed mixes to be used to restore areas, if needed, in coordination with the BLM. The\ngoal is that by the end-of-life of the Project, up to 65 percent of the original application area\n(3,341 out of 5,114 acres) would have perennial vegetation cover. Decommissioning would then\nbe accomplished without greatly increasing the disturbance. Alternative 1, like the Proposed\nAction, would also require implementation of an Integrated Weed Management Plan over the\nlifespan of the Project.\n\n**_2.4.3.2 Alternative 1 Construction_**\n\nThe key feature of this alternative that differs from the Proposed Action is that the solar array blocks would be\nconstructed utilizing overland travel methods. Table 2.4-2 summarizes the guidelines for soil and vegetation\nmaintenance for this alternative broken down by construction method. _Overland travel/maintain sustainable_\n_vegetation_ describes alternative, non-traditional development methods for construction of solar arrays. This\nconstruction method is expected to improve the retention of native vegetation, wildlife habitat, soils, and seed\nbanks, while minimizing air quality impacts (i.e., from fugitive dust) and water resource impacts. This\nalternative construction method, thus, falls under the second \"tier\" of the mitigation hierarchy established by the\nBLM, which is to \"minimize impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation\"\n(BLM 2021, chap. 3). Methods that include overland travel but result in driving and crushing vegetation are\nexpected to maintain root systems and reduce impacts to vegetation and hydrology as compared with disc and\nroll and grading methods. Restoration in these areas of crushed vegetation is expected to be more feasible over\ntime, as described below under \"Operation and Maintenance (O&M)\".\n\nThe methods necessary for maintaining vegetation and establishing limited travel paths require specialized\nequipment and additional construction time. Therefore, the construction period for Alternative 1 would likely be\nlonger than for the Proposed Action, at an estimated 18 months versus 16 months. The additional construction\ntime would be in the early stages of the Project, during site preparation and PV array installation. The total\nestimated number of workers are expected to be the same as described for the Proposed Action.\n\n**Table 2.4-2** **Avoidance/Disturbance Area by Project Construction Method under Alternative 1**\n\n\n-----\n\nNotes:\n\na Equals 40 percent of the solar array development blocks, not including areas of permanent disturbance for facility\nfeatures (e.g., equipment pads, access roads, conduits, detention basins)\n\nb Equals 40 percent of the solar array development blocks, not including areas of permanent disturbance for facility\nfeatures (e.g., equipment pads, access roads, conduits, detention basins)\n\nc Equals 20 percent of the solar array development blocks, not including areas of permanent disturbance for facility\nfeatures (e.g., equipment pads, access roads, conduits, detention basins), which may be graded for topography or other\nneeds.\n\nd Assumes that 20 percent of the overland travel/crush vegetation would recover during operations. This estimate is\nconservative but allows for on-going impacts to vegetation from operations and is a minimum.\n\ne O&M facility (2.8 acres), substation (8.3 acres), access roads and driveways (89 acres), water storage facility (4 acres),\nBESS (2.7 acres), equipment areas (1.4 acres), aboveground collector lines (1.2 acres), feeder lines (40 acres), swales\n(21 acres), retention basins (45 acres)\n\n**_2.4.3.3 Operation and Maintenance (O&M)_**\nDuring O&M, areas of vegetation would be maintained. Vehicle trips between solar array blocks would be\nlimited to access roads and the shortest path to equipment off of the access roads, with the goal of minimizing\nimpacts to existing vegetation. Vehicular access would occur in the smallest possible vehicle to complete the\nactivity or, when possible, on foot. Vegetation under panels and around equipment would be trimmed or mowed\nas needed to ensure safe operation. The Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan would be initiated following\ncompletion of the primary construction phase, during O&M. The goal would be to restore vegetation so that up\nto 65 percent of the total initial application area is maintained with vegetation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_2.4.3.4 Decommissioning_**\nDecommissioning would be as described in Section 2.2.5 for the Proposed Action and consist of removing all\nProject materials from the site. Areas without vegetation through the solar array blocks would be used for access\nto the maximum extent possible. Restoration and reclamation of the remaining Project disturbance would then\nbe undertaken. Decommissioning would be performed as identified in the Decommissioning and Site\nReclamation Plan.\n\n##### 2.5 Alternative 2: Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction\n\n**2.5.1 Overview**\nAlternative 2 (Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction) includes providing supplemental access\nduring construction to disperse some of the vehicle trips that under the Proposed Action would be concentrated\non East Walker Road. This alternative was discussed with Nevada Copper, who has agreed to allow for\nsupplemental access through their private property on the Pumpkin Hollow Mine, contingent on a mutual legal\nagreement identifying the terms of use. Cooperative agreements would also be obtained with LADWP to also\nuse existing roads on the BLM land for which they hold a non-exclusive ROW.\n\n**2.5.2 Elements the Same as the Proposed Action**\nAll elements of the Project would be the same as those of the Proposed Action under this alternative. The solar\nsite and gen-tie would be constructed exactly as described for the Proposed Action (unless this alternative is\nlayered with Alternative 1, in which case all elements would be the same as for Alternative 1). The primary\ndifference in this alternative is the addition of supplemental access routes used during construction.\n\n**2.5.3 Elements Unique to Alternative 2**\n\n**_2.5.3.1 Project Design_**\nThe current number of vehicle trips per day is estimated in the Air Quality Report (RCH 2023). The estimated\ntrips by Project phase are provided in Table 2.2-2 and would include several hundred roundtrips per day during\npeak construction. The Proposed Action includes one access route to the Project site, relying on East Walker\nRoad to connect to Reese River Road. East Walker Road is a local, mostly unpaved road serving two residences,\nagricultural areas, and recreationalists accessing the Walker River State Recreation Area and the BLM lands.\n\nAlternative 2 would involve partial use of one or two additional access options for a portion of the vehicle trips\nin order to reduce the impact on the residences along East Walker Road, as well as resulting impacts\ncompounded by traffic associated with the Walker River State Recreation Area. No upgrades or new disturbance\nwould be associated with the use of supplemental access routes. Maintenance of the supplemental access roads\nis expected and would be the responsibility of the Applicant. The supplemental access routes are summarized in\nTable 2.5-1 and shown in Figure 2.6-1 and Figure 2.6-2.\n\n**Table 2.5-1** **Supplemental Access Road Options under Alternative 2**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_2.5.3.2 Project Construction_**\nSupplemental access routes would only be utilized during Project construction. The purpose of the supplemental\naccess routes would be to reduce some of the vehicle trips along East Walker Road by dispersing them across\nother access routes. A typical scenario could include reducing worker-vehicle travel by diverting up to 25\npercent to other routes. Construction workers would likely be commuting from the Reno and Carson City\nmetropolitan areas. A percentage of workers could be directed to the supplemental access routes.\n\n**_2.5.3.3 Project O&M and Decommissioning_**\nAlternative 2 would not apply to the O&M phase of the Project. The supplemental access routes would only be\nutilized during Project construction. Decommissioning requires approximately one-third the workers and trips\nand thus impacts would be reduced compared with the Proposed Action. The routes, particularly through the\nNevada Copper property, may not exist at the time of decommissioning.\n\n##### 2.6 Alternative 3: Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West\n\n**2.6.1 Overview**\nAlternative 3 (Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West) entails connecting the gen-tie line from the\nProject to the proposed Greenlink West Transmission Project through a new switching station under the\nGreenlink West line. This alternative requires authorizations that are not guaranteed at this time. NV Energy\nmust approve this alternative in consideration of system operation and integration. This alternative's feasibility\nalso depends upon the approval and construction of the proposed Greenlink West Transmission Project, which is\ncurrently also undergoing NEPA review (the 90-day public comment period on the Draft EIS concluded on\nAugust 3, 2023).\n\n**2.6.2 Elements the Same as the Proposed Action**\nAll of the Project solar site components (i.e., solar PV modules/arrays, BESS, linear and ancillary facilities,\nwater retention facilities, operations, and maintenance facilities) would be the same as described for the\nProposed Action, with the exception of the location of the on-site substation. The Project solar site access road\nwould also be the same as described for the Proposed Action (unless this alternative is layered with Alternative\n1, in which case all elements except for the substation would be the same as for Alternative 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.6-1** **Proposed Alternative 2 Access Route Option: Pursel Lane to LADWP Transmission Line**\n**Road**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.6-2** **Proposed Alternative 2 Access Route Option: LADWP Transmission Line Road from US**\n**95A**\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.6.3 Elements Unique to Alternative 3**\n\n**_2.6.3.1 Project Design_**\nAlternative 3 entails moving the proposed 525 kV substation on the solar site further south along the eastern\nboundary of the site, building a new switching station under the proposed Greenlink West line, and building a\nnew 0.54-mile-long 525 kV gen-tie between the solar site substation and new switching station, as shown in\nFigure 2.6-3. The gen-tie would include approximately four tubular steel or H-frame transmission line poles\nsimilar to those described for the Proposed Action. A switching station is an electrical substation with only one\nvoltage level, whose only function is switching actions. Switching stations do not have transformers but can tie\ntogether two or more electrical circuits through switches. The switching station would connect into the proposed\nGreenlink West transmission line to feed power generated at the Project solar site into NV Energy's system. The\nproposed Greenlink West transmission line would then continue on to the Fort Churchill substation. Under\nAlternative 3, the on-site 525 kV substation would displace solar arrays as they are located under the Proposed\nAction design. Solar arrays would instead be located in the area of the substation under the design of the\nProposed Action, with no net change in the number of solar arrays. The on-site substation footprint would\nremain at 8.3 acres. The new switching station under the proposed Greenlink West transmission line would be\napproximately 8 to 10 acres in size. The new switching station would be owned and operated by NV Energy. All\nof the new infrastructure, including the gen-tie line and the switching station, would be located within the\nexisting Section 368 designated utility corridor adjacent to the solar site. The estimate of new disturbance\nassociated with the gen-tie is shown in Table 2.6-1.\n\n**Table 2.6-1** **Summary of Estimated New Permanent Disturbance for the Gen-tie under Alternative 3**\n\n|Component|Acres of impact|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|Gen-tie line|0.5|Approximately 0.54 mile of gen-tie line with 4 H-frame poles; approximately 0.12 acre cleared out around each|\n|New access road along gen-tie line|1.3|Approximately 0.54 mile of new 20-foot-wide access road from the Project substation to the switching station|\n|New switching station|10|A new switching station within the adjacent Section 368 utility corridor, between the solar site and Greenlink West.|\n|All|11.8||\n\n\n\n**2.6.3.1** **_Project Construction_**\nThe Project substation would be constructed as described for the Proposed Action. The new switching station\nwould also require the same construction methods as the on-site substation. Switching station construction\nwould consist of site grading, concrete equipment foundation forming and pouring, crane-placed electrical and\nstructural equipment, underground and overhead cabling and cable termination, ground grid trenching and\ntermination, control building erection, and installation of all associated systems including, but not limited to,\nheating, ventilating, and air conditioning system components; distribution panels; lighting; communication and\ncontrol equipment; and lightning protection. The switching station area would be excavated to a depth of 10\nfeet. After installation of the grounding grid, the area would be backfilled, compacted, and leveled, followed by\nthe application of 6 inches of aggregate rock base. Equipment (i.e., breakers, buswork, and metal dead-end\nstructures) installation would follow. A prefabricated control house would be installed to house the electronic\ncomponents required for the substation equipment.\n\n**2.6.3.1** **_Project O&M and Decommissioning_**\nThe O&M and decommissioning phases would be the same as for the Proposed Action; however, only 0.54 mile\nof gen-tie line would need to be maintained. NV Energy would maintain the switching station.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.6-3** **Proposed Alternative 3: Gen-tie and Substation Connecting into Proposed Greenlink West**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2.7 Federal Lead Agency Preferred Alternative\nUnder NEPA, the _preferred alternative_ is a preliminary designation of the lead agency\u2019s preference of action\namong the Proposed Action and alternatives. The identification of a preferred alternative does not constitute a\ncommitment or decision in principle by the BLM, and there is no requirement for the BLM to select the\npreferred alternative in the ROD. Under NEPA, a lead agency may select a preferred alternative for a variety of\nreasons, including the agency\u2019s priorities in addition to the environmental considerations discussed in the Draft\nEIS. The BLM, at the ROD, may also choose components of different alternatives, as presented, and evaluated\nin the Draft EIS. In accordance with NEPA (40 CFR \u00a7 1502.14(d)), the BLM has designated all elements of\nAlternative 1, Major Drainage Avoidance, Fenced Corridors, and Vegetation and Topography Maintenance\ncombined with Alternative 2, Supplemental Access During Construction as the preferred alternative.\n\n##### 2.8 Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study\nThe BLM eliminated from further detailed analysis any alternatives that met the following criteria (BLM 2008,\n\u00a76.6.3):\n\n-  It is ineffective (it would not respond to the purpose and need).\n\n-  It is technically or economically infeasible (consider whether implementation of the alternative is\n\nlikely given past and current practice and technology; this does not require cost-benefit analysis or\nspeculation about an applicant\u2019s costs and profits).\n\n-  It is inconsistent with the basic policy objectives for the management of the area (such as, not in\n\nconformance with the LUP).\n\n-  Its implementation is remote or speculative.\n\n-  It is substantially similar in design to an alternative that is analyzed.\n\n-  It would have substantially similar effects to an alternative that is analyzed.\n\nSeveral alternative sites, technologies, and methods were considered but eliminated, as described in Table 2.8-1.\nAdditional information on the alternatives considered but eliminated is provided in the _Alternatives Report_\n(Panorama 2023).\n\n**Table 2.8-1** **Alternatives Considered but Rejected**\n\n\n\n|Alternative|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Private land|Much of the available private land in the region is dominated by agricultural use or terrain that is not suitable for solar development or is part of the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine. Additionally, 85 percent of the land in Nevada is owned by the federal government, which limits the amount of available private land for development.|\n|Other BLM-administered lands|Other suitable areas are proposed for other energy development projects (primarily solar) or have other constraints, including potential impacts from military operations, tribal lands, and special land uses, such as wetlands around the Fort Churchill substation or proximity to the Pony Express Trail and Lahontan Reservoir/Carson River.|\n|Brownfield/degraded land|The USEPA tracks 480,000 contaminated sites for potential reuse for renewable energy development as part of its Re-Powering America\u2019s Lands Initiative. As with the private land alternatives previously described, it would be technically possible to develop solar energy on these contaminated sites. However, there were no identified sites in the region that would be sufficiently large enough to support a 700 MWac project with feasible access to transmission lines and substations with adequate capacity.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Alternative|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Other types of renewable energy: solar, wind or geothermal|Other types of renewable energy projects, including wind, geothermal, and other solar technologies, were eliminated from detailed consideration because they would not meet the BLM\u2019s purpose and need to respond to the Applicant\u2019s application.|\n|Distributed generation|Distributed-generation solar was also eliminated from detailed consideration. Distributed generation refers to the installation of small- scale solar energy facilities at individual locations at or near the point of consumption (e.g., use of solar PV panels on a business or home to generate electricity for on-site consumption). Distributed-generation systems usually generate less than 10 MW and thus would fail to promote the BLM\u2019s objective to permit substantial quantities of renewable energy generation.|\n|Demand-side management|This potential alternative to utility-scale solar PV energy development consists of a variety of approaches to reduce electricity use, including energy efficiency and conservation, building and appliance standards, and load management and fuel substitution. With population growth and increasing demand for energy, conservation and demand-side management alone is not sufficient to address energy demands. These efforts also do not respond to federal mandates to promote, expedite, and advance the production and transmission of environmentally sound energy resources, including renewable energy resources and, in particular, cost-competitive solar energy systems at the utility scale.|\n|Concentrated photovoltaic technology|Concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) technology uses layers of wafers to absorb different wavelengths of sunlight and provide more power conversion efficiency than typical PV panels. This technology requires dual tracking technology to provide critical alignment with direct sunlight in order to be efficient. CPV panels are mounted on taller structures than traditional PV panels (as high as 40 feet above the surface). This alternative was eliminated from detailed study because this technology is relatively new and there are uncertainties for long-term performance reliability. Further, the manufacturing capacity to supply large-scale utility projects has not been proven to date.|\n|Alternative access via Minister Road|Commenters during scoping suggested the use of Minister Road, through the Walker River State Recreation Area, to connect to Reese River Road as an alternative access route to the solar site. This alternative was evaluated through coordination with Nevada State Lands, who stated that use of their new road connecting to Minister Road through the park would only be used for park access and would not be compatible with construction traffic. Therefore, this alternative was rejected.|\n\n\n##### 2.9 Comparison of Effects\nThis Draft EIS examines the range of reasonable alternatives developed to meet the Project\u2019s purpose and need,\nalong with a No Action alternative. A No Action alternative is required to be considered under NEPA (40 CFR \u00a7\n1502.14) as a basis for comparison. Table ES-2 in the Executive Summary to this EIS provides a comparison of\nthe alternatives as described in Section 2.2.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Chapter 3 Affected Environment and Environmental Impacts\n\n##### 3.1 Introduction \n\n**3.1.1 Affected Environment**\nThis chapter describes the existing or affected environment, including conditions and trends of the human\nand physical environment that could be affected by the Proposed Action and alternatives described in\nChapter 2. The affected environment is presented for the Project area, including the Project solar site and\nall areas on which ancillary facilities (i.e., access roads, gen-tie lines) are proposed to be sited. Resources\naddressed include those that occur within, are adjacent to, or are associated with the Proposed Action and\nalternative analysis area (referred to as the _study area_ for select resource topics). The affected\nenvironment establishes the baseline from which environmental effects are assessed.\n\n**3.1.2 Environmental Effects**\nThis chapter also describes environmental consequences, referred to as \u201cimpacts\u201d or \u201ceffects\u201d of\nimplementing the alternatives. Impacts are defined as modifications to the environment over existing\nconditions that are caused by a proposed action. Direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts are described in\nthis chapter. Terminology for discussion of environmental impacts under NEPA is defined in part 1508 of\nthe April 20, 2022, Phase 1 CEQ revisions of the Regulations for Implementing the NEPA (40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7\n1508.1(g)).\n\nPotential impacts were evaluated based on the assumption that environmental commitments would be\nimplemented as part of the proposed activities. Environmental commitments may include BMPs,\nminimization measures, mitigation measures, conservation measures, environmental compliance,\ncompensatory mitigation, programmatic design features (PDFs), SOPs, or other commitments. Proposed\nenvironmental commitments summarized for each resource are in Appendix E, _Mitigation, Monitoring,_\n_and Reporting Measures_ . The BLM would implement these measures directly or through third-party\ndelegation to avoid, minimize, and mitigate environmental impacts of the Project.\n\nBecause the Project is tiered to the 2012 Western Solar Plan, the Project is subject to the Western Solar\nPlan PDFs (Appendix A in the Western Solar Plan), which would potentially reduce the impacts of the\nProject (BLM and DOE 2012). PDFs are presented first with \u201cWestern Solar Plan PDF\u201d followed by the\nacronym for the applicable resource topic used in the Western Solar Plan. The CRMP identifies SOPs that\ncould reduce effects, which are also identified where applicable in the analysis.\n\n**3.1.3 Mitigation Measures Identified in the Analysis**\nProject specific mitigation measures (MMs) are proposed, where applicable, based on potential for\nadverse effects from the Project. An MM is a specific requirement of Project implementation that either\navoids, reduces, or minimizes a potential environmental impact. MMs are designed to be appropriate,\neffective, and enforceable in accordance with CEQ guidance (CEQ 2011). Each mitigation measure is\nassigned an alphanumeric reference code consisting of \u201cMM\u201d followed by an abbreviation representing\nthe applicable resource topic, and a serialized number. For example, mitigation measures applicable to\nimpacts to land use are assigned a reference code beginning with \u201cMM-LU-.\u201d\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.2 Cumulative Impacts\n\n**3.2.1 Overview**\nCumulative impacts are the incremental impacts of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future\nactions in combination with the direct and indirect impacts of the Project. Other projects are considered\nregardless of what agency (federal or non-federal), or individual undertakes the project. The cumulative\nimpacts analysis in this EIS considers the potential for cumulative impacts in the vicinity of the Project, in\nLyon and Mineral counties, Nevada. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but\ncollectively significant actions taking place over a period of time (40 CFR \u00a7 1508.1(g)(3)). Under NEPA,\na cumulative impacts analysis is accomplished through the following steps:\n\n-  Establish geographic and temporal scopes for analysis.\n\n-  Identify the affected environment, including resources, ecosystems, and human communities, their\nbaseline conditions, and current stresses in relation to regulatory thresholds.\n\n-  Identify past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions within the geographic and temporal\nscope and their impacts to resources.\n\n-  Determine the incremental environmental effects of the project combined with past, present, and\nreasonably foreseeable future actions and provide a discussion of the magnitude and significance of\neach.\n\n**3.2.2 Geographic Extent and Timeframe for Cumulative Analysis**\nTable 3.2-1 provides the geographic scope of the cumulative impacts analysis for potentially affected\nresources within the Project area. The geographic scope of impacts will vary based on the nature of the\nresource being evaluated and the distance at which an impact might occur. For example, the analysis of\nair quality impacts may have a larger geographic scope than that for soils.\n\nThe temporal scope of this cumulative impacts analysis is the lifespan of the Project, from\nimplementation to 30 years in the future, followed by the decades over which restoration activities could\ncontinue. Projects with potential cumulative impacts for which an application has been submitted to a\npermitting agency or that are in the planning stage have been included in the analysis. Past and present\nprojects are only included if their current impacts would aggregate with those of the Proposed Action or\nalternatives. Past projects are only included to the extent that their impacts are ongoing. For example, the\nPumpkin Hollow Copper Mine project is a past project, but plans for its future operation could contribute\nto cumulative impacts when considered with the Project.\n\n**Table 3.2-1** **Geographic Extent of the Cumulative Impacts Analysis by Resource Topic**\n\n\n\n\n|EIS topic or topics|Geographic scope|Explanation|\n|---|---|---|\n|Soils, water uses, and jurisdictional waters|Mason Valley Hydrographic Unit|Impacts from other projects within the same areas of surface hydrologic connectivity and within the connected groundwater system could aggregate. Soil destabilization and erosion from other projects in the same areas of surface water hydrologic connectivity could occur downstream.|\n|Biological resources: general wildlife, special status species, and vegetation|The Mason Valley and Wassuk Range|Projects within this geographic boundary would be expected to affect similar vegetation, habitat, and wildlife. This geographic scope accounts for the area within which similar populations of species or habitat could occur.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|EIS topic or topics|Geographic scope|Explanation|\n|---|---|---|\n|Land use, recreation, socioeconomic, environmental justice, public health, and safety; and mineral resources|Lyon and Mineral counties; Nye and Churchill counties considered for socioeconomic impacts|Projects within these geographic extents may also affect the same land uses and recreational resources, public services and communities, and mineral resources.|\n|Rangeland Resources|Gray Hills, Perry- Springs Deadman, Black Mountain, Parker Butte, and Cleaver Peak allotments|Project that could affect the same allotments could have cumulative impacts.|\n|Air quality|Mason Valley Hydrographic Basin|Projects within the same basin used for air impact analyses as the Project could have cumulative impacts. In Nevada, hydrographic basins are also used to address air quality.|\n|Climate change|Nevada and California|Cumulative impacts from GHGs were considered for the states where the power generated from the solar facility could offset emissions from carbon-based power- generation sources.|\n|Visual resources, recreation|Within an approximately 15-mile radius of the Project site|Projects within this geographic area could have adverse impacts on the same visual and recreational resources.|\n|Historic resources, Native American religious concerns|Within 5-mile radius of the Project site|Impacts within this geographic area are likely to originate with the same ethnographic group or from the same historic period, and could have an impact on the visual, auditory, and atmospheric conditions of a resource.|\n|Transportation|Transportation systems within Lyon, Churchill, and Mineral counties|Projects that use the same roadways would have the potential to contribute to cumulative effects.|\n|Public health and safety|Lyon and Mineral counties|Projects that are located nearby could contribute to cumulative effects. Projects that utilize the same roadways could also contribute to cumulative effects and would be project-specific. Lyon and Mineral counties are considered for cumulative effects related to landfill and fire and emergency services.|\n\n\n**3.2.3 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Projects**\nThe cumulative impacts analysis includes all projects related to renewable energy, transportation,\ninfrastructure improvement, pipeline and electric transmission, and other large-scale, near-term plans that\nmeet the following criteria:\n\n-  Projects for which environmental documents are in preparation or finalized,\n\n-  Projects in a detailed design or planning phase,\n\n\n-----\n\n-  Projects approved but not yet under construction (e.g., published NTPs, funding for construction),\n\n-  Projects approved and under construction, and\n\n-  Projects in the bidding or research phase that are reasonably likely to be proposed.\n\nThe actions listed in Table 3.2-2 and shown in Figure 3.2-1 are those within the geographic scope of the\ncumulative impacts analysis that are ongoing or reasonably foreseeable and that, along with the Project,\ncould contribute to cumulative impacts. None of the listed actions are directly connected to or dependent\non the Proposed Action or alternatives.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.2-2** **Projects within the Geographic Scope of the Cumulative Impacts Analysis**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.2-1** **Cumulative Projects**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.3 Air Quality and Climate Change\n\n**3.3.1 Introduction**\nThis section addresses the potential impacts of the Project on air quality. The information presented in\nthis section is based on the Air Quality Technical Report for the Libra Solar Project (RCH 2023).\n\n**3.3.2 Analysis Area**\nAir quality is a regional resource and is neither defined nor limited by Project or jurisdictional boundaries.\nHydrographic basins, defined as the area from which precipitation flows into a single stream or drainage,\nare also used to define local airsheds as the air quality management unit throughout Nevada. The\nhydrographic basins were developed based on topography and, thus, airsheds tend to be consistent with\nthose basins. The Project area is located within the Mason Valley Hydrographic Unit or Basin, as shown\nin Figure 3.3-1.\n\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) are global pollutants and have atmospheric lifetimes of up to several thousand\nyears, which permits dispersal of GHGs around the globe. The analysis area for GHG emissions,\ntherefore, is global. This analysis focuses on Nevada and California where emissions are quantifiable\n(IPCC 2014).\n\n**3.3.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.3.3.1 Overview_**\nThe Project site is located near Yerington, Nevada. Yerington has a dry desert climate with hot and dry\nsummers and mild winters. The average temperature for summer is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and the\nwinter temperatures rarely reach freezing. The area experiences little humidity. The region receives\napproximately 5 inches of rain per year and 4 inches of snow (Visual Crossing Corp. n.d.). Snow\naccumulates on the ground for only a few days per year most years.\n\nThe Project is in a region with moderate wind. The windier part of the year lasts for approximately 4\nmonths, from mid-February through the end of June. The calmest month of the year in Yerington is\nJanuary (WeatherSpark, n.d.). Meteorological data were obtained for the air quality analysis from Fallon\nStation for the five-year period of 2017 through 2021 (NOAA 2017; 2022). Winds are predominantly\nfrom the south-southwest-and west-northwest, with an average wind speed of 3.2 meters per second (7.2\nmph) **.**\n\n**_3.3.3.2 Air Standards_**\nThe USEPA has set national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and the\nenvironment. NAAQS are defined for six criteria pollutants: ozone (O 3 ), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen\ndioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), lead (Pb), and particulate matter (PM). The State also has established\nair quality standard for the same pollutants (Nevada Administrative Code [NAC] Title 40 \u00a7 445B.22097).\nThe State and NAAQS-established thresholds for the criteria air pollutants at different averaging periods,\nalong with the primary and secondary standards for each, are provided in Table 3.3-1.\n\nPrimary standards are concentration thresholds that provide public health protection, including for\nsensitive populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards are concentration\nthresholds provide public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant, including,\nbut not limited to, protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and\nbuildings.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.3-1** **Mason Valley Hydrographic Basin**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.3-1** **Nevada and National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Criteria Pollutants**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Pollutant|Averaging time|Nevada standards|NAAQS primary standards|NAAQS secondary standards|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|O 3|8 hours|0.070 ppm|0.070 ppm (137 \u00b5g/m3)|0.070 ppm (137 \u00b5g/m3)|\n|O 3|1 hour|0.10 ppm (195 \u00b5g/m3)1|N/a|N/a|\n|CO|1 hour|35 ppm (40 \u00b5g/m3)|35 ppm (40 \u00b5g/m3)|N/a|\n|CO|8 hours|9 ppm (10 \u00b5g/m3)2 6 ppm (7 \u00b5g/m3)3|9 ppm (10 \u00b5g/m3)|N/a|\n|NO 2|1 hour|100 ppb (188 \u00b5g/m3)|100 ppm (188 \u00b5g/m3)|N/a|\n|NO 2|Annual arithmetic mean (AAM)|0.053 ppm (100 \u00b5g/m3)|0.053 ppm (100 \u00b5g/m3)|0.053 ppm (100 \u00b5g/m3)|\n|SO 2|1 hour|75 ppb (196 \u00b5g/m3)|75 ppb (196 \u00b5g/m3)|\u2014|\n|SO 2|3 hours|0.5 ppm (1,300 \u00b5g/m3)|N/a|0.5 ppm (1,300 \u00b5g/m3)|\n|SO 2|24 hours|0.14 ppm (365 \u00b5g/m3)|0.14 ppm (365 \u00b5g/m3)4|N/a|\n|SO 2|AAM|0.030 ppm (81 \u00b5g/m3)|0.030 ppm (81 \u00b5g/m3)4|N/a|\n|Pb|Calendar quarter|N/a|1.5 \u00b5g/m3|1.5 \u00b5g/m3|\n|Pb|Rolling 3-month average|0.15 \u00b5g/m3|0.15 \u00b5g/m3|0.15 \u00b5g/m3|\n|PM 10|24 Hours|150 \u00b5g/m3|150 \u00b5g/m3|150 \u00b5/m3)|\n|PM 10|AAM|50\u00b5g/m3|50 \u00b5g/m3|50 \u00b5g/m3|\n|PM 2.5|24 hours|35\u00b5g/m3|35 \u00b5g/m3|35 \u00b5g/m3|\n|PM 2.5|AAM|12.0 \u00b5g/m3|12.0 \u00b5g/m3|15 \u00b5g/m3|\n|H S 2|1 hour|0.08 ppm (112 \u00b5g/m3)|N/a|N/a|\n\n\n_mg/m_ _[3]_ _: milligrams per cubic meter       ppm: parts per million          ppb: parts per billion_\n\n\u00b5 _g/m_ _[3]_ _: micrograms per cubic meter    AAM: annual arithmetic mean_\nNotes:\nNot applicable (N/a) indicates that the standard is not applicable to the Project.\nFor the Lake Tahoe Basin, #90\nFor areas less than 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) above mean sea level\nFor areas at or greater than 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) above mean sea level\nApplies to areas of nonattainment; however, there are no SO2 nonattainment areas in Nevada.\n_Source:_ (State of Nevada 2020; USEPA 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.3.3.3 Air Quality Designations_**\nThe USEPA designates attainment status for air quality standards within hydrographic basins. Attainment\nareas meet or exceed ambient air quality standards, and non-attainment areas do not. States with nonattainment areas are required to draft a State Implementation Plan (SIP), which must include measures\nthat the state will take to improve air quality. Once the ambient air quality standards and additional\nredesignation requirements in the Clean Air Act are met, the USEPA designates the area as a\n\"maintenance area\" (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), n.d.-a). The Project area is located\nwithin the Mason Valley Hydrographic Basin, which is in attainment for all pollutants. The Washoe\nCounty Hydrographic Basin is the nearest basin to the west of the Project area, and where Project workers\nare expected to originate as it contains the cities of Reno and Carson City. The Washoe County\nHydrographic Basin is designated as a non-attainment area for PM 10 , a maintenance area for CO, and\nattainment for all other criteria pollutants. Background concentrations for NO 2 , CO and SO 2 can be found\nin the Air Quality Technical Report for the Libra Solar Project (RCH 2023).\n\n**_3.3.3.4 Greenhouse Gases/Climate Change_**\nThe term greenhouse gasses (GHGs) refers to gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. GHGs are released\ninto the earth\u2019s atmosphere through a variety of natural processes and human activities. The primary\nGHGs are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), ozone, and water vapor. Others\ninclude hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ). GHG\nemission inventories are measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e).\n\nAn expanding body of scientific research supports the theory that global climate change is currently\naffecting weather patterns, average sea level, ocean acidification, chemical reaction rates, and\nprecipitation rates, and that it will increasingly do so in the future. The climate and several naturally\noccurring resources within the Western U.S. could be adversely affected by global climate change. Mass\nmigration and/or loss of plant and animal species could also occur. Potential effects of global climate\nchange that could adversely affect human health include more extreme heat waves and heat-related stress;\nan increase in climate-sensitive diseases; more frequent and intense natural disasters such as flooding,\nhurricanes, and drought; and increased levels of air pollution.\n\nNevada\u2019s GHG emissions inventory mirrors trends occurring across the Western U.S., where\ntransportation-sector emissions (35 percent) exceed those from the energy sector (32 percent). Industrial,\nresidential, and commercial emissions are growing rapidly while those associated with other sectors\nremain relatively consistent (State of Nevada 2020). Nevada generates emissions comprising less than 1\npercent of the overall emissions in the U.S., which is proportional to the State\u2019s relative population.\n\n**3.3.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.3.4.1 Methods_**\nThe air quality analysis presented herein follows guidance within Sections 5.11.1 and 5.11.2 and\nAppendices A.2 and M.13 of the Western Solar Plan (BLM and DOE 2012). Emissions generated during\nconstruction of the Project were calculated based on the detailed list of equipment and the schedule\npresented in the Project\u2019s POD (Arevia 2023). Dispersion modeling of the air emissions generated during\nconstruction was conducted to determine the maximum concentrations of criteria pollutants at receptor\nlocations near the Project area (including the solar site, gen-tie, and access road) to evaluate compliance\nwith NAAQS and Nevada air quality standards. Receptor locations include anywhere that a person could\nfeasibly be, including at the fence line of the Project solar site and adjacent to the gen-tie alignment.\nModeling methods and assumptions are provided in more detail in the Air Quality Technical Report for\nthe Libra Solar Project (RCH 2023).\n\nIn addition to criteria air pollutants, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) were also evaluated. HAPs (such as\nacetaldehyde, formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and xylene) are gaseous organic and inorganic chemicals\nand PM, which the USEPA has identified to have known or suspected potential to cause cancer or other\nserious health effects. HAPs are emitted by a wide range of sources, including construction equipment\nand industrial facilities. The CAA mandates that the USEPA regulate HAP emissions. While no ambient\n\n\n-----\n\n(i.e., outdoor) standards for HAP emissions levels have been developed, standards for HAP emissions\nemitted by stationary sources have been established. HAP emissions are calculated based on speciation\nfactors that are essentially the percentage of an individual HAP within the total VOC emissions from\nconstruction equipment and vehicles.\n\nThe Project is in an attainment area for all NAAQS and is not subject to new or modified major source [1]\npermitting under the CAA\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) analysis (USEPA 2023). For\ninformational purposes, however, an analysis was undertaken to calculate the air pollutants from the\nProject within the nearest location to Yosemite National Park and the other Class I areas, including\nDesolation Wilderness, Mokelumne Wilderness, Emigrant Wilderness, and Hoover Wilderness. These\nClass I areas are located within 62 miles of the Project area, the maximum recommended modeling\ndistance for American Meteorological Society/USEPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD)(USEPA 2018).\nThe closest Class I areas are Mokelumne Wilderness and Hoover Wilderness, located approximately 42\nmiles from the Project area. Yosemite National Park is located approximately 57 miles from the Project\narea.\n\n**_3.3.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Air Quality.** Construction-related emissions are expected to be short-term. Emissions include combustion\nemissions (CO, NO 2 , SO 2 ) and fugitive dust. Construction-related fugitive dust emissions would vary\nfrom day to day, depending on the level and type of activity, silt content of the soil, and the weather.\nSustained high winds (greater than 25 mph) occur less than two percent of the time in the Project region\n(NOAA 2017; 2022). Fugitive dust, including wind-driven fugitive dust, generated during construction\nwould include not only PM 10 but also larger particles. These dust particles would fall out of the\natmosphere within several hundred feet of the construction areas, which could result in nuisance-type\nimpacts. Table 3.3-2 presents the maximum combustion and fugitive dust emission (CO, NO 2 , SO 2 , PM 10 ,\nand PM 2.5 ) concentrations that were modeled for construction. The modeling was based on the Proposed\nAction, incorporating combustion and fugitive dust controls during 2025 and assuming water would be\ntrucked to the Project area. Table 3.3-3 presents the same information but assumes use of an on-site\ngroundwater well. With combustion and fugitive dust controls, the maximum concentrations for PM 10 ,\nPM 2.5 , and the combustion-emissions criteria pollutants would not exceed the NAAQS and Nevada state\nstandards. Impacts would not be substantially adverse.\n\nThe maximum impacts related to fugitive dust emissions would occur over the narrow geographical areas\nnear the Project site and along the unpaved access road and gen-tie line over brief time periods (i.e.,\nisolated conditions). The areas of maximum daily PM 10 conditions (given elevated background levels)\nthat are near sensitive receptors include two residences on East Walker Road, one residence along the\ngen-tie at the eastern boundary of the Mason Valley WMA, and several residences located approximately\n0.5 mile from the gen-tie in an area just north of US 95A. Attachment 3 of the Air Quality Technical\nReport for the Libra Solar Project (RCH Group 2023) provides modeling isopleths of concentration\nresults for the maximum Project PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations, assuming dust controls. The areas of\nhighest PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations include locations along the northern portion of the gen-tie and just\nnorth of US 95A along the gen-tie as well as along the access road. Sensitive receptors are located near\nUS 95A location of highest concentration, although no standards would be exceeded with the use of\ncontrols.\n\n1 Major sources are medium to large industrial facilities that emit or have the potential to emit at least 100 tons per year of any\ncriteria pollutant, or any stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 250 tons per year of any criteria pollutants.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.3-2** **Estimated Maximum Concentration with Controls (Trucking Option)**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Col1|CO 1-hour|CO 8-hour|NO 2 1-hour|NO 2 annual|SO 2 1-hour|SO 2 3-hour|PM 10 24-hour|PM 10 annual|PM 2.5 24-hour|PM 2.5 annual|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Project modeled concentration 3 (\u00b5g/m )|20.6|5.72|21.3|1.58|2.23|1.25|36.2|7.26|2.79|0.93|\n|Background concentration 3 (\u00b5g/m )|2,483|1,852|88.1|21.1|8.45|6.41|103|18.4|16.6|4.80|\n|Total concentration 3 (\u00b5g/m )|2,504|1,858|109|22.7|10.7|7.66|139|25.6|19.4|5.73|\n|NAAQS/NV state 3 standard (\u00b5g/m )|40,000|10,000|188|100|196|1,300|150|50|35|12|\n|Total percent of NAAQS/NV state standard|6.3|18.6|58.2|22.7|5.4|0.6|92.6|51.2|55.5|47.7|\n|Exceed NAAQS/NV state standard?

Western Solar Plan PDF AQC 1-1\nrequires applicants to consult with the BLM in the early phases of project planning to help determine\nconformance with NAAQS and other potential constraints associated with the proposed Project area. The\nApplicant has complied with this measure during the NEPA process and through preparation of the Air\nQuality Technical Report for the Libra Solar Project (RCH 2023). Western Solar Plan PDF AQC 2-1\nrequires projects to identify measures to minimize air quality impacts, such as using equipment that meets\nor exceeds emission standards specified in the state code of regulations and that meets the applicable\nUSEPA Tier 3 and Tier 4 emissions requirements, and preparation of a dust abatement plan. These\nelements are included in the draft Dust Control and Air Quality Plan (Panorama 2023). As part of the\nplan, fugitive dust control measures would be implemented during construction, including but not limited\nto applying water in sufficient quantities to prevent the generation of visible dust plumes, applying the\nBLM-approved soil binders to uncovered areas, re-establishing ground cover as quickly as possible, using\na wheel-washing system to remove bulk material from tires and vehicle undercarriages before vehicles\nexit the site, and maintaining effective cover over exposed areas. The CRMP SOPs require projects to\nminimize soil disturbance, comply with the CAA and federal and state emission standards, and develop\npollution abatement programs to provide for environmental protection and reasonable resource uses.\nWhile not modeled as paved, the Project also includes potentially paving the first 1.5 miles of East\nWalker Road in coordination with the two homeowners on East Walker Road and Lyon County Roads\nDepartment. Paving would further reduce dust generation on East Walker Road. While some exposure to\ndust and pollutants could still occur, exceedances of NAAQS (CO, NO 2 , SO 2 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 ) would not\noccur from construction of the solar site, access road, or gen-tie with implementation of the design\nfeatures.\n\nTable 3.3-4 presents the maximum CO, NO 2 , SO 2 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 concentrations at Yosemite National\nPark during 2025, the maximum intensity construction period, from emissions from the Proposed Action,\nassuming inclusion of fugitive dust controls. The maximum concentrations for all pollutants and\naveraging periods are well below the PSD increment. No adverse effect on Yosemite National Park would\noccur. The Air Quality Technical Report for the Libra Solar Project (RCH 2023) also presents the\ncalculation of effects to Desolation Wilderness, Mokelumne Wilderness, Emigrant Wilderness, and\nHoover Wilderness, none of which would be adverse.\n\n**GHG.** The estimated total construction GHG emissions for the Project is 16,877 metric tons of CO 2 e. The\nestimated annual average construction GHG emissions for the Project is 5,626 metric tons of CO 2 e. As\nindicated in Table 3.3-5, the 30-year amortized construction-related GHG emissions would be 563 metric\ntons of CO 2 e per year. Per the USEPA GHG equivalencies calculator, the maximum emissions generated\nduring construction of the Project would be the same as produced by 776 to 1,199 households annually\nfrom energy consumption (USEPA 2020a). Cumulative GHG emissions have been linked with\naccelerated global climate change. One-time generation of GHG emissions would be required for Project\nconstruction. The total quantity of construction emissions generated, however, would be significantly less\nthan a single year of equivalent energy production using non-renewable resources.\n\nConstruction would contribute to an elevated level of CO 2 over a short period of time (16 months);\nclimate change, however, is a long-term phenomenon. While the Project would result in a high level of\nemissions for a brief time, those emissions would be offset by the operational benefits of renewable\nenergy power generation over the long-term. The net impact would be beneficial rather than adverse.\n\n**Hazardous Air Pollutants.** In addition to criteria air pollutants, HAP may be emitted during construction\nthrough the use of construction equipment and industrial facilities. Mobile sources of hazardous air\npollutant emissions result from fuel combustion in both on-and off-road vehicles. For vehicle operations\nassociated with construction activities, worker commuting, and deliveries, the speciated hazardous air\npollutant emissions include compounds such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and\nxylene. See the Air Quality Technical Report for the Libra Solar Project (RCH 2023) for more details\nregarding the HAP calculations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.3-4** **Estimated Maximum Concentration at Yosemite National Park with Controls**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Col1|CO 1-hour|CO 8-hour|NO 2 1-hour|NO 2 annual|SO 2 1-hour|SO 2 3-hour|PM 10 24-hour|PM 10 annual|PM 2.5 24-hour|PM annual 2.5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Project Modeled concentration (\u00b5g/m3)|0.37|0.06|3.35|0.03|0.06|0.02|0.22|0.01|0.02|<0.01|\n|PSD Class I increment (\u00b5g/m3)|\u2014|\u2014|\u2014|2.5|25|\u2014|8|4|2|1|\n|Exceed PSD Class I increment (Yes/No)?|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|\n\n\n|Table 3.3-5 Estimated Construction Greenhouse Gas Emissions|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Source|Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) (metric tons)|\n|Annual construction emissions 2024|2,617|\n|Annual construction emissions 2025|12,259|\n|Annual construction emissions 2026|1,984|\n|Total construction emissions|16,858|\n|Annual average construction emissions|5,619|\n|Annual amortized construction emissions (30-year)|562|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe highest HAPs emitted during construction would be formaldehyde at 2.4 tons. The combined total of\nall HAPs emitted during construction would be approximately 7.6 tons. The potentially emitted HAPs\nwould be less than 10 tons per year for any individual HAP, and less than 25 tons per year for all HAPs\ncombined; therefore, the Project would not be considered a major HAP emission source during\nconstruction.\n\n**Public Health** **_._** _Coccidioidomycosis_ , commonly known as valley fever, is primarily a disease of the lungs\nthat is common in the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico. Valley fever can be transported\nthrough fugitive dust generated during construction and decommissioning. The Project would implement\nWestern Solar Plan PDFs AQC1-1 and AQC1-2 as well as mitigation measure MM AIR-1 and MM AIR2 to further reduce fugitive dust impacts during construction. With the implementation of these measures,\nthe risk to workers of contracting valley fever would be minimized. See Section 3.16, Public Health and\nSafety for more information.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\n**Air Quality.** Vehicles transporting workers to and from the solar site and used to conduct maintenance\nactivities would emit some pollutants. Some emissions may occur through the use of generators, but\nemissions are anticipated to be minimal as generators would only be used in case of emergencies and\npossibly during periodic maintenance, and thus only a few days per year. O&M could involve soil\ndisturbance in portions of the Project area (for repairs and maintenance), but disturbance would be mostly\nlimited to access roads. Wind events could disturb soil within the Project area, resulting in erosion and\nfugitive dust; however, high wind events are relatively uncommon in the Project region. Under existing\nconditions, the fugitive dust emissions of PM 10 and PM 2.5 from wind erosion are estimated at 1,968 tons\nand 295 tons, respectively. During initial operation, the net increase in uncontrolled fugitive dust\nemissions of PM 10 and PM 2.5 from wind erosion is estimated at 2,475 tons and 371 tons, respectively.\nThat is, prior to the re-establishment of Project soil compaction, without dust controls, the fugitive dust\nemissions due to wind erosion would be higher than the existing conditions. With fugitive dust controls\nbut without vegetation re-establishment, the net decrease in fugitive dust emissions of PM 10 and PM 2.5\nfrom wind erosion would be 635 tons and 95 tons, respectively, compared to existing conditions. Fugitive\ndust controls within the solar site would likely include application of dust palliatives as approved by the\nBLM. The Dust Control and Air Quality Plan required by NDEP, and the Western Solar Plan PDFs for\nthe O&M phase of the Project would identify measures for reducing dust, with monitoring to ensure offsite impacts do not occur.\n\nThe facility is also incentivized to limit fugitive dust on site as dust can dramatically affect the energy\noutput of solar cells. Studies in the U.S. have found losses of 5 percent to 23 percent, depending on the\ntype of dust and angle of the solar panel surface (Maghami et al. 2016). In addition to panel cleaning, dust\ncontrols (e.g., watering, applying regulation-compliant palliatives) are commonly used throughout active\nsolar fields to minimize output losses. The Applicant would also implement Western Solar Plan PDF\nAQC 3-1, which outlines compliance and monitoring requirements during operations and CRMP SOP 1,\nwhich requires limiting soil disturbance. Western Solar Plan PDF AQC 3-1 dictates that areas that have\nbeen graded, scraped, bladed, compacted, or denuded of vegetation must be monitored and treated. The\nDust Control and Air Quality Plan would address methods for implementing this requirement. If during high\nwind events (i.e., sustained winds over 25 mph), dust over the solar site is visibly greater than surrounding\nareas, or if valid complaints are received, treatment would be required. Compliance methods include\nreapplying palliatives or water as necessary for effective fugitive dust management and ensuring\ncompliance of all combustion sources with State emission standards (e.g., best available control\ntechnology requirements). Fugitive dust impacts during O&M would be reduced as compared with the\nbaseline conditions and thus would not be adverse.\n\nAir emissions from fossil fuel facilities that could be offset by the Project were compared for California and\nNevada. As a lower-emission power-generation source, the Project would likely reduce the overall\ncomposite emission rates associated with regional electrical generation. However, these benefits might\naccrue at locations far removed from the solar facilities and over a wide geographic area. To assess these\nbenefits, emissions avoided were estimated on the assumption that the Project would generate 700 MWac of\n\n\n-----\n\nelectrical power (see Table 3.3-6 and Table 3.3-7). Based on the results, air quality impacts from the\nProject are expected to be beneficial versus adverse during the O&M phase.\n\n**GHG.** A 700 MWac solar facility would generate approximately 1,704,549 MWh of electricity per year. [2]\nUsing the average fossil fuel power-generation emissions factor for California and Nevada of\n0.439 metric tons CO 2 e per year (USEPA 2022), a similar sized fossil fuel power generation facility\nwould generate 747,728 metric tons of CO 2 e emissions. The 30-year (operational period of the facility)\nequivalent fossil fuel power-generation emissions would be 22,282,296 metric tons CO 2 e. The Project, in\ncontrast, would generate between an estimated 32,000 and 38,000 metric tons CO 2e over the 30-year life,\nas shown in Table 3.3-8. O&M would generate some emissions from testing and use of generators, but\nemissions would be minimal since use would only be for a few days per year. Desert landscapes and\nvegetation provide carbon sequestration and stock that would be lost from site development, but at the\nmaximum level, that loss would not be considerable.\n\nProject O&M would offset a significant quantity of emissions from fossil fuel power generation. The\noffset amount would be significantly higher than the emissions generated. The Project would have\nbeneficials impacts to GHG emissions compared to non-renewable energy generation.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\n**Air Quality.** Decommissioning activities would be similar to construction activities but assumed to occur\non a more limited scale and over a shorter duration. The potential effects on ambient air quality would be\ncorrespondingly smaller than those from construction activities. Associated effects on ambient air quality\nwould be temporary and not adverse.\n\nThe Project would implement Western Solar Plan PDF AQC 4-1, which states that reclamation of the site\nwould incorporate the PDFs listed under Western Solar Plan AQC 2-1 to reduce the likelihood of air\nquality impacts associated with decommissioning. An adverse effect on local air quality from fugitive dust\nemissions during decommissioning is unlikely but could occur. Following decommissioning, areas of\nbare soil could continue to contribute to fugitive dust emissions for many years. The Site Restoration and\nRevegetation Plan and the Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan would include restoration and\nrevegetation requirements to meet site performance standards for mitigation. Implementation of these\nplans would restore areas to pre-construction conditions, but it may take decades to a century or more.\nSince the area would be de-compacted to facilitate restoration, fugitive dust could be locally increased as\ncompared with baseline conditions; however, the Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan and\nDecommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan would mandate methods of soil stabilization during the\nrestoration process. The remote location of the site and limited vehicle traffic, as well as the stabilization\nmeasures, would limit the effects of dust generated and, thus, impacts are not anticipated to be adverse.\n\n**GHG.** Decommissioning and reclamation activities would be similar to construction activities but occur\non a more limited scale and with shorter duration. Potential effects on climate change would be\ncorrespondingly smaller than those from construction activities. Decommissioning activities would last\nfor a shorter period. The GHG emissions generated during decommissioning would be offset by the\nbeneficial effects achieved throughout the lifetime of the Project.\n\n2 Refer to Section 2.5.2 for a description of the methodology to determine MWh of electricity per year.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.3-6 Operations Emissions Offset (tons per year) Without Controls**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Emissions source|VOCs|SO 2|CO|NOx|PM 10|PM 2.5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Worker vehicles|0.04|<0.01|0.35|0.01|0.07|0.01|\n|Pickup trucks|<0.01|<0.01|0.03|<0.01|<0.01|<0.01|\n|Onsite equipment|0.01|0.01|0.03|0.01|0.01|0.01|\n|Pumps & generators (trucking/well option)|<0.01 / 0.04|0.02 / 0.40|0.03 / 0.57|0.03 / 0.62|<0.01 / 0.03|<0.01 / 0.03|\n|Water trucks (trucking/well option)|0.01/ 0.00|<0.01 / 0.00|0.13 / 0.00|0.14 / 0.00|0.06 / 0.00|0.01 / 0.00|\n|Net fugitive dust|N/a|N/a|N/a|N/a|2,475.21|371.28|\n|Total|0.06 / 0.09|0.03 / 0.41|0.57 / 1.01|0.19 / 0.50|2,475.35 / 2,475.34|371.31 / 371.34|\n|Total equivalent emissions generated for 700 MW non-renewable energy power generation|N/a|68.18|N/a|374.57|N/a|N/a|\n|Emissions offset (trucking/well option)|0.06 / 0.09|68.15 / 67.77|0.57 / 1.01|374.38 /374.07|2,475.35 / 2,475.34|371.31 / 371/34|\n\n\nNote: N/a indicates that information is not available or not applicable.\n\n**Table 3.3-7 Operations Emissions Offset (tons per year) With Controls**\n\n\n**0.57 /**\n**1.01**\n\n\n**374.38**\n**/374.07**\n\n\n**2,475.35 /**\n**2,475.34**\n\n\n**371.31 /**\n**371/34**\n\n\n\n\n|Emissions source|VOCs|SO 2|CO|NOx|PM 10|PM 2.5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Worker vehicles|0.04|<0.01|0.35|0.01|0.07|0.01|\n|Pickup trucks|<0.01|<0.01|0.03|<0.01|<0.01|<0.01|\n|Onsite equipment|0.01|0.01|0.03|0.01|0.01|0.01|\n|Pumps & generators (trucking/well option)|<0.01 / 0.04|0.02 / 0.40|0.03 / 0.57|0.03 / 0.62|<0.01 / 0.03|<0.01 / 0.03|\n|Water trucks (trucking/well option)|0.01 / 0.00|<0.01 / 0.00|0.13 / 0.00|0.14 / 0.00|0.06 / 0.00|0.01 / 0.00|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Emissions source|VOCs|SO 2|CO|NOx|PM 10|PM 2.5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Net fugitive dust|N/a|N/a|N/a|N/a|-634.86|-95.23|\n|Total|0.06 /0.09|0.03 /0.41|0.57 /1.01|0.19 /0.50|-634.74 /-634.75|-95.20 /-95.18|\n|Total equivalent emissions generated for 700 MW non-renewable energy power generation|N/a|68.18|N/a|374.57|N/a|N/a|\n|Emissions offset (trucking/well option)|0.06 / 0.09|68.15 / 67.77|0.57 / 1.01|374.38 / 374.07|-634.74 / -634.75|-95.20 / -95.18|\n\n\nNote: N/a indicates that information is not available or is not applicable.\n**Table 3.3-8** **Operational Emissions Offset Over the Life of the Project (CO** **2** **e Metric Tons)**\n\n\n\n\n|Emissions source|Project emissions (CO2e metric tons)|\n|---|---|\n|Annual amortized construction emissions (30-year timeframe)|562|\n|Substation|270|\n|Worker trips|120|\n|Offroad equipment/pickup trucks|34|\n|Pumps/generators (trucking/well option)|5/106|\n|Water trucks (trucking/well option)|244/0|\n|Total annual proposed action (trucking/well option)|1,236/1,093|\n|Total 30-year proposed action (trucking/well option)|37,067/32,777|\n|Total equivalent emissions generated for 700 MW non-renewable energy power generation over life of the project (29.8 years)|-22,282,296|\n|Loss of carbon sequestration 1 (30 years)|63,048\u2013993,001|\n|Emissions offset during Project O&M (trucking option)|-22,186,471 to -21,256,518|\n|Emissions offset during Project O&M (Well Option)|-22,182,181 to -21,252,228|\n\n\nNote: Annual carbon sequestration rates vary, depending on the study, from 0.16 MT carbon/acre/year to 2.52 MT carbon/acre/year. One ton of\ncarbon is equivalent to 3.67 tons of CO2 (Allen, Jenerette, and Santiago 2023). A loss period of 30 years is assumed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nPast and present actions, including existing land development, have contributed to the existing air quality\nconditions in the analysis area. Construction-related ground disturbance projected for other projects in the\nanalysis area between 2025 and 2026 would likely be limited to the proposed Greenlink West\nTransmission Project (Greenlink West) and, potentially, expansion activities at the Pumpkin Hollow\nCopper Mine. The contribution to cumulative impacts from the Project would constitute an incremental\nincrease in air pollutants within the analysis area. Other solar projects would be implemented at separate\ntimes or would be geographically further from the Project and, therefore, the construction impacts to air\nquality are not expected to overlap with the effects of the Project to result in a cumulative effect.\n\nGreenlink West would be constructed adjacent to the Project\u2019s gen-tie, and localized dust emissions could\noccur. The annual construction emissions in tons for the Project for 2025 are shown in Table 3.3-9 along\nwith estimated annual emissions for Greenlink West (BLM 2023) The emissions estimated for Greenlink\nWest are for the entire 472 miles, of which approximately 18 miles would overlap with the Project. The\nlocal contribution to cumulative effects from Greenlink West would be minor and would not be expected\nto result in adverse impacts to air quality if work were to occur concurrently. Similar dust suppression\nmeasures would be applied for Greenlink West as for the Project, which would minimize the potential for\ncumulatively adverse impacts to air quality from dust emissions.\n\n**Table 3.3-9** **Annual Construction Emissions (tons) with Controls**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Emissions source|VOC (metric tons)|CO (metric tons)|NOx (metric tons)|SO 2 (metric tons)|PM 10 (metric tons)|PM 2.5 (metric tons)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Project (2025)|11.5|42.3|66.5|5.84|163|22.7|\n|Greenlink West (annual), for 18 miles|0.3|2.1|3.4|0.008|0.3|0.05|\n\n\nThe Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine expansion includes pit mining, which involves a large amount of\nground disturbance and could produce significant emissions. The timing of work and emissions are not\ncurrently known and, thus, cumulatively significant air emissions cannot be ruled out. It is assumed that\nthe mining operation, which is located on private land, would be subject to the NDEP air quality\nstandards and would require dust control to also avoid impacts in conflict with air quality standards. The\nProject would include Western Solar Plan PDFs and control measures to minimize the Project\u2019s\ncontribution to an otherwise adverse cumulative air quality impact.\n\nOther projects, including other solar developments near the Fort Churchill substation, could be\nconstructed during the O&M phase of the Project. These projects would generate emissions similar to\nthose described for the Project; however, the Project would result in minimal emissions during O&M and,\nin fact, in offsetting emissions would not result in net adverse cumulative effects. Decommissioning of\nthe Project would not occur at the same time as any other currently foreseeable projects. There would be\nno adverse cumulative impacts from decommissioning.\n\nCumulative GHG emissions from Greenlink West and other solar projects would be similar to the Project\nand would be beneficial over the life of those projects. The Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine expansion may\nresult in significant emissions of GHGs; however, the Project, as a renewable energy project, would not\ncontribute to an otherwise significant cumulative effect.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.3.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\n**Air Quality**\nUnder Alternative 1, the maximum ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants would occur at the gentie line and access road during construction, as with the Proposed Action. Resultant ambient pollutant\nconcentrations would be very similar to those shown for the Proposed Action in Table 3.3-2 and Table\n3.3-3. This alternative would result in increased duration of impacts since construction would take\napproximately 2 months longer; however, annual emissions estimates would not increase (i.e., duration,\nbut not intensity, of construction would change). Emissions would not exceed Nevada air quality\nstandards or NAAQS with controls, application of Western Solar Plan PDFs AQC 1-1 and AQC 2-1, and\napplication of the CRMP SOPs. With fugitive dust controls, the net (decrease as a result of Alternative 1)\nfugitive dust emissions of PM 10 and PM 2.5 from wind erosion would be a reduction of 953 tons and 143\ntons, respectively, compared to the existing condition and a net reduction of 318 tons and 48 tons,\nrespectively, compared with the Proposed Action during construction, since this alternative would result\nin maintaining as much as 64 percent of the on-site vegetation during construction and O&M across the\nProject area.\n\nAlthough particulate matter and fugitive dust impacts would likely be reduced from the decreased level of\nmaximum disturbance and the type of disturbance during construction, Action Alternative 1 could\npotentially result in an increase (compared to the Proposed Action) in fugitive dust during O&M. Areas of\nmaintained vegetation would not be subject to soils compaction and, thus, may have greater dust\nemissions (similar to the baseline conditions) during rare high wind events than for the Proposed Action.\nDisturbed, graded areas would be treated with soils stabilization and, thus, dust emissions are still\nexpected to be less than baseline conditions. Adverse impacts to air quality are not anticipated under this\nalternative. Decommissioning impacts would be similar to those for the Proposed Action. Less\nreclamation work would be needed under this alternative to return the solar site to its pre-construction\ncondition since as much as 64 percent of the original application area\u2019s vegetation and surface topography\nmay be maintained as compared with 36 percent for the Proposed Action. Impacts to air quality are not\nexpected to be adverse.\n\nCumulative impacts would be similar to those described for the Proposed Action, and the Project would\nnot contribute to significant adverse cumulative impacts to air quality.\n\n**GHG**\nGHG emissions impacts would be the same as for the Proposed Action. The Project would have similar\nimpacts during construction, which would be offset by the Project O&M phase as a renewable energy\nproject. Under this alternative, the Project would have the same total electrical power output as the\nProposed Action, thus conferring the same benefits. Carbon sequestration losses would be reduced since\nvegetation and soil topography would be maintained to a greater extent. The Project under this alternative\nwould not contribute to significant adverse cumulative impact to GHG emissions and climate change.\n\n**_3.3.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\n\n**Air Quality**\nAlternative 2, utilizing supplemental access routes, would result in a change of location of vehicle exhaust\nand dust emissions but would not change the total emissions as compared with the Proposed Action.\nEmissions would not exceed Nevada state air quality standards and NAAQS with controls, application of\nWestern Solar Plan PDFs AQC 1-1 and AQC 2-1, and the CRMP SOPs. Since total emissions would not\nchange, the air quality impacts during construction, O&M, and decommissioning and cumulative impacts\nwould be the same as for the Proposed Action, and a net change in adverse impacts is not anticipated.\nSupplemental access route roads are unpaved and would not change the Project\u2019s overall vehicle trips and\nmiles traveled. The result would be reduced dust generation in a given location with dust generation\ncreated instead along the supplemental access routes. Mitigation measures such as implementing speed\n\n\n-----\n\nlimits and application of dust palliatives would minimize dust emissions along supplemental access\nroutes.\n\n**GHG**\nGHG emissions impacts would be the same as for the Proposed Action since, under this alternative,\nconstruction of the solar site and gen-tie alignment would not change. Use of supplemental access routes\nwould not increase travel times or vehicle trips; thus, GHG emissions are anticipated to be similar to those\nfor the Proposed Action. Adverse effects would not occur, and the net beneficial impacts would be the\nsame as for the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.3.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\n\n**Air Quality**\nUnder Alternative 3, the 24.1-mile-long gen-tie would be shortened to 0.54 mile, and a switching station\nwould be added under Greenlink West. Emissions associated with the construction of the gen-tie and\naccess along the gen-tie would be reduced as compared with the Proposed Action given the reduced\nground disturbance and reduction in vehicle miles traveled. Overall emissions would therefore be reduced\nand would not exceed NAAQS or Nevada state air quality standards with controls, application of the\nWestern Solar Plan PDFs AQC 1-1 and AQC 2-1, and the CRMP SOPs. The primary benefit of Action\nAlternative 3 would be elimination of impacts from dust emissions to sensitive receptors north of US 95A\nand near the Mason Valley.\n\nDuring O&M, vehicle miles traveled to maintain the gen-tie and switching station would be reduced\nalong unpaved roads, reducing fugitive dust emissions as compared with the Proposed Action. Overall,\nemissions during O&M would be reduced compared with the Proposed Action and would not be adverse.\nNet impacts to air quality would also be beneficial, like for the Proposed Action. Decommissioning would\nhave similar effects as described for the Proposed Action but would likewise be reduced since the area of\ndisturbance associated with the gen-tie alignment would be reduced. Impacts to air quality are not\nexpected to be adverse. Cumulative impacts would be similar to those described for the Proposed Action,\nand the Project would not contribute to significant adverse cumulative effects.\n\n**GHG**\nGHG emissions impacts would be similar to those for the Proposed Action but slightly reduced since,\nunder this alternative, the solar site would not change but the gen-tie construction emissions would be\nreduced. Adverse effects would not occur, and the same net beneficial impacts would be anticipated.\n\n**_3.3.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the solar site, gen-tie line, and substation would not be developed. No\nsoil or vegetation disturbance would occur, and no impacts to air quality would occur. Climate change\nwould continue as defined by current trends and no renewable energy alternative to carbon-intensive\nfossil fuels would be provided. No adverse effects would occur.\n\n**_3.3.4.7 Relevant Required Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP_**\n**_Standard Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nPDFs from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B.

[3]\n\nThe BLM has allowed the use of several dust palliatives on other projects. If dust palliatives are used in\nplace of water for the Project, the total amount of water needed during construction would be reduced.\nThe Applicant may opt to use such palliatives, as authorized by the BLM for the Project. The soil\nbinder/dust palliatives that are proposed for the Project, and which the BLM previously has allowed are:\n\n-  Road Bond 1000\n\n-  For roads and heavy traffic areas: Soil Sement\n\n-  For non-traffic areas on finer soils: Formulated Soil Binder FSB 1000\n\n-  Alternatives as approved by the BLM\n\n**MM AIR-2: Dust Control and Stabilization**\n\nA Dust Control and Air Quality Plan for Project construction and O&M shall be prepared, which\nidentifies the methods of reducing dust while demonstrating off-site impacts of the methods used would\nnot occur. The Dust Control Plan shall also identify upgrading portions of the Project access road and\ngen-tie access roads to an all-purpose surface where particulate emissions are highest to greatly reduce\nemissions, if feasible.\n\n**_3.3.4.8 Irreversible or Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nEmissions of criteria air pollutants associated with construction activities would result in short-term\nincreases in the concentrations of pollutants in the affected airshed. Sources of air pollution associated\nwith long-term operations would increase as a result of substation and solar facility maintenance, but at a\nmuch lower level than during the construction phase (<1 percent of the impacted counties\u2019 total emission\ninventory for all evaluated pollutants). Localized increases in the concentrations of air pollutants would\npersist during the O&M of the Project but would dissipate relatively quickly following the Project\ndecommissioning. Therefore, there would be no irreversible or irretrievable impacts to air quality in the\n\n3 An Air Quality Index value of 100 corresponds to the ambient air quality standard for the pollutant, which is the level\nUSEPA has set to protect public health.

Residual impacts would\ninclude the generation of some limited dust and air pollutants, but all emissions are expected to be below\nstandards for all alternatives.\n\n##### 3.4 Soils\n\n**3.4.1 Introduction**\nThis section is based on information provided in the Preliminary Geotechnical Investigation Report for\nthe Libra Solar Project (Westwood 2023b), as well as soil data and information produced by the National\nCooperative Soil Survey (NRCS n.d.). The BLM has no specific regulatory authority that addresses soil\nprotection. However, soils are linked to the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act through dust emissions,\nand soil conservation is specifically cited in FLPMA.\n\n**3.4.2 Analysis Area**\nThe analysis area for soils is limited to the Project site, gen-tie lines, and access road and adjacent areas.\nThis geographic extent is appropriate because effects of the Project\u2019s construction and O&M may result\nin erosion and soil losses that could impact the immediate area and areas adjacent the Project site and offsite components. The analysis area is used to provide context for current conditions and, ultimately, for\nthe direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts related to loss of soil resources or soil productivity.\n\n**3.4.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.4.3.1 Soil Types_**\nThe Libra Solar Project is located within the Great Basin section of the Basin and Range Physiographic\nProvince (Fenneman and Johnson 1946). The Basin and Range province is characterized by steep,\nprotruding mountain ranges separated by flat basins (NPS 2020a). The Great Basin Desert is a temperate\ndesert with hot, dry summers and snowy winters, and drastic elevation changes (NPS 2021b). The valleys\nare dominated by sagebrush and shadescale vegetation.\n\nAccording to the Geologic Map of Nevada (J. H. Stewart and Carlson 1978) the site is predominately\nmapped within pediment deposits, alluvial plain, and undifferentiated alluvial deposits. These deposits are\ndescribed as poorly sorted, boulders, and muddy, uncemented gravel, with weakly developed desert\npavement at the surface. The Wassuk group is also mapped within the Project boundary, which is\ndescribed as weakly cemented fine silty sandstone to sandy siltstone. Surrounding units in the Wassuk\nRange are mainly quartz and volcaniclastic sediment. The Web Soil Survey data indicates a depth to\nduripan restrictive layer between 9 and 18 inches (25 cm to 46 cm) below ground surface (bgs)\nthroughout the majority of the Project solar site (NCSS 2022b). \u201cDuripan\u201d is described as cemented silica\ncreating hardpan soil. Duripans occur mostly in arid or semiarid climates. Soils with duripans are often\ngeographically associated with areas of volcanic activity. Volcanic glass weathers rapidly, providing an\nample supply of soluble silica to cement the underlying soil. Duripan layers restrict root growth. Soil\nborings found that hardpan or duripan was encountered between 3.5 and 15 feet bgs, represented by a\npink and white calcareous cementation layer (Westwood 2023b)\n\nThe solar site is comprised of two primary soil units:\n\n-  **Deefan-Rawe-Bluewing association** (approximately 63 percent of the site): Classified as clayey\ngravel (GC), silty gravel (GM), gravel with silt (GW-GM, GP-GM) and gravel (GW, GP) with a\ncemented layer between 10 to 26 inches. Minor sandy units are also noted. This unit is derived\nfrom mixed alluvium.\n\n-  **Smedley-Annaw-Izo association** (approximately 21 percent of the site): Classified as silty gravel\n(GM), and gravel with silt (GW-GM, GP-GM) with a cemented layer between 15 to 33 inches.\nMinor sandy units are also noted. This unit is derived from mixed alluvium.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe gen-tie crosses numerous soil units along its 24.1-mile length, most in pediment and alluvial deposits,\nbut it also crosses numerous alluvial flats and stream terraces in the north, closer to the Fort Churchill\nsubstation and in proximity to the Mason Valley WMA and the Walker River. The Project access road\ncrosses several soil units, with most being pediment and alluvial deposits like the solar site, including the\nCleaver association (NCSS 2022a). Maps showing all of the soils units are provided in the Preliminary\nGeotechnical Investigation Report for the Libra Solar Project (Westwood 2023b).\n\n**_3.4.3.2 Soils Characteristics_**\n\n**Water and Wind Erosion**\nThe soil erodibility factor (known as the K factor) is used to quantify a soil\u2019s susceptibility to water\nerosion in two erosion models: the universal soil loss equation (USLE) and the revised universal soil loss\nequation (Palacky 1988). K factor values range from 0.02 (least erodible soils) to 0.7 (most erodible\nsoils). The shallow soils found on the Project solar site have K factors ranging from 0.10 to 0.20, and thus\nhave low susceptibility to erosion (NCSS 2022c).\n\nThe purpose of wind erodibility groups (WEGs) is to predict a soil type\u2019s susceptibility to wind erosion,\nwhich varies according to soil texture, organic matter content, soil carbonate, rock fragment content, and\nmineralogy. WEG values are assigned to soil map units within the SSURGO system and range from a\nvalue of 1 to 8: high wind erosion susceptibility (WEG 1 or 2), moderate wind erosion susceptibility\n(WEG 3, 4), slight wind erosion susceptibility (WEG 5, 6, or 7), and no susceptibility to wind erosion\n(WEG 8). The Project solar site has WEGs in the 5 and 6 range and, thus, have slight wind erodibility\npotential. The gen-tie alignment area soil types vary widely, with wind erosion potential ranging from 1\nto 8. The access road, like the solar site, has mostly low to moderate erosion potential, with WEGs in the\nrange of 5 to 6, but at its more western extent near Yerington, pockets of high soil susceptible to wind\nerosion are found with a WEG of 1 (NCSS 2022e).\n\n**Soil Corrosion Potential**\nAs reported in the Preliminary Geotechnical Investigation Report (Westwood 2023b), chemical\nconstituent test results indicated that the site has soil pH ranging from 7.0 to 7.4, and contains up to 8,421\nmg/kg of soluble sulfates, and up to 2,398 mg/kg soluble chlorides. These values, along with other soil\nproperties such as moisture content, soil type, and electrical resistivity, indicate that the subsurface\nconditions are moderately corrosive to steel piles (Palacky 1988), with sulfate levels that are corrosive to\nconcrete.\n\n**Soil Productivity (T factor, Soil Loss Tolerance)**\nAn important factor in the consideration of soil productivity (how well soils support biotic growth) are\nthresholds for soil loss due to erosion. The T factor is defined as the soil loss tolerance (as measured in\ntons per acre), which is the maximum amount of soil erosion at which the quality of a soil as a medium\nfor plant growth can be maintained. Erosion classes range on a scale from 1 to 5, with the 5 being the\nmost resilient to future erosional losses of soil and 1 being the least resilient. For the purposes of this\nanalysis, T factor classes of 1 to 2 are considered to have low soil loss tolerance (i.e., highly susceptibility\nto erosion impacts and loss of soil productivity). The Project solar site\u2019s primary soil composition units\nhave the following T factors: Deefan, 1; Rawe, 3; Bluewing, 5; Smedley, 1; Izo, 5; and Annaw, 2. The\ndata suggests that while variable, much of the solar site has a low soil loss tolerance (NCSS 2022d). The\nerosion potential is low to moderate, but if the soils do experience erosion, soil productivity is affected.\nMost of the access road areas have a T factor of 1 as well. The gen-tie alignment crosses many soil units,\nbut most have higher T factor values, indicating higher resilience related to soil loss and soil productivity.\n\nNone of the soils on the solar site are identified as supporting Prime Farmland. Areas of the gen-tie may\nsupport agricultural uses and farmland; however, the gen-tie does not cross any active areas of farming.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.4.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.4.4.1 Methods_**\nA qualitative analysis was completed to assess the impacts of the Project site preparation methods on soil\ncharacteristics for the Proposed Action and each action alternative. The analysis addresses water and wind\nerosion of soils, soil corrosion and impacts on the Project structures, and impacts related to loss of soil\nproductivity.\n\n**_3.4.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Decommissioning**\n**Wind and Water Erosion of Soils.** The Proposed Action components would result in temporary and\npermanent disturbance of soils. Soils in the Project area (including the solar site, access road, and gen-tie)\nhave the potential to erode from both wind and heavy rain or water run-off. The Proposed Action includes\ntraditional construction methods, which would result in surface and topsoil disturbance of approximately\n64 percent of the application area (3,306 acres), as well as 104 acres along the gen-tie, and 10 acres along\nthe access road. The Project area has low to moderate wind and water erosion potential, but pockets of the\nsolar site, a small section of the access road, and some areas along the gen-tie alignment have high wind\nerosion potential, which would be exacerbated by the disturbance from construction.\n\nIncreased erosion on the Project site from stormwater overland flows could result in increased deposition\nof fine-grained sediments into the surrounding washes, which would likely flow downstream and off site\nbefore settling out of the washes. Because no uses such as agriculture or built structures are located\ndownstream for 5 miles or more, periodic increases in fine-grained sediment loads and deposition are not\nexpected to have adverse effects. The washes in the region move large quantities of all sizes of sediment\nas part of the natural desert processes, changing course and depositing soil during large storm events.\nNote that Section _3.5: Water Resources_ addresses changes in the volumes of water runoff.\n\nA SWPPP is required as part of the BLM ROW grant and would be prepared and implemented during\nconstruction. It would include installation of Project-specific erosion control BMPs (as identified in the\nSWPPP). Western Solar Plan PDF SR2-1 requires BMPs to minimize soil erosion (BLM and DOE 2012,\napp. A). The CRMP SOPs 4 and 7 require rehabilitation and restoration of disturbed areas to also\nminimize soil erosion (BLM 2001).\n\nTemporary disturbance areas (approximately 184 acres) include temporary workspaces, yards, and\nstaging areas that may be used for construction. Temporary areas of disturbance would be restored in\naccordance with the BLM-approved Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan following the completion of\nprimary construction activities. Permanent disturbance is associated with all long-term Project\ncomponents needed for operation and maintenance of the Project solar site and associated components\nthroughout the 30-year lifespan of the Project, including the solar arrays, BESS, roads and access routes,\ndistribution power, substations, gen-tie and transmission infrastructure, and permanent fencing. These\nareas would be reclaimed after the Project\u2019s 30-year lifespan, and reclamation would occur in accordance\nwith the BLM-approved Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan. Part of the Site Restoration and\nRevegetation Plan would include using the salvaged and managed topsoil, as required by Western Solar\nPlan PDF SR2-1 (BLM and DOE 2012, app. A).\n\nWind erosion could also occur across bare soils, which is also addressed in Section _3.3 Air Quality and_\n_Climate Change_ . Appropriate dust abatement measures would be identified in the Dust Control and Air\nQuality Plan, to be implemented during construction and operation, in compliance with NDEP\nrequirements. These measures would include BMPs such as limiting vehicle speeds, watering of active\nareas, watering of stockpiles, watering on roadways, and track-out control at site exits. Dust palliatives\nand soil stabilizers would also be used to reduce the potential for wind erosion on the solar site. With the\npreparation of a SWPPP and the Dust Control and Air Quality Plan along with the implementation of\nWestern Solar Plan PDFs, direct adverse effects from soil erosion caused by construction would be\nminimized. An additional mitigation measure, MM SOILS-1, would require that the Applicant implement\nphasing of disturbance in order to minimize the amount of area of destabilized soils at a time. Phasing\n\n\n-----\n\ncould include ground disturbance and development of roads, pads, and infrastructure in 1,000-acre units\nat a time. The areas would likely be developed to the point that array posts are installed, and then the\nground stabilized, before opening the next 1,000 acres of development. This measure would reduce the\namount of soils subject to wind and water erosion at a time.\n\n**Corrosivity and Soil Hazards.** Direct effects caused by corrosive and unstable soils could occur during\nO&M if foundations for the arrays and other equipment are not appropriately designed, which could result\nin failure of the components and additional effects to various environmental parameters from conducting\nextensive repairs. MM SOILS-2 requires a design-level geotechnical evaluation and implementation of\nrecommendations to manage corrosive soils and cemented soils, as well as minor areas of slope instability\n(e.g., near major drainages) to be conducted prior to construction, with recommendations incorporated\ninto the Project\u2019s final design. Direct effects caused by unstable soils during O&M would be minimized\nby implementing the recommendations of the design-level geotechnical evaluation.\n\nThe solar site includes a duripan horizon of cemented silica a few feet below the surface, which could\ncause construction difficulties. In order to ensure that piles are appropriately designed so as not to be\ndamaged or impacted by the layer, MM SOILS-2 requires that the design-level geotechnical evaluation\nalso address the best foundation methods given the hardpan layer as well as pile testing prior to\nconstruction. Implementation of this measure would minimize effects that could occur should\ninappropriate methods be prescribed and that could otherwise result in damage to the facility.\n\n**Soil Productivity.** Construction activities would affect soil productivity through temporary and\npermanent disturbance of the Project site (including the solar site, gen-tie, and access road). The soils on\nthe solar site tend to have a low erosion tolerance and lose the ability to support vegetation, if eroded.\nDiscing and grading would have similar effects to the soil productivity. The Project under the Proposed\nAction would likely cause a loss of soil productivity on over 3,306 acres of land for the solar site, plus an\nadditional 104 acres for the gen-tie and 10 acres for the access road, which may take decades to a century\nor more to be restored after decommissioning of the facilities This effect would be adverse since the soils\non the Project solar site provide vegetation and forage for wildlife and livestock that would be lost for a\nlong time. Methods to minimize effects include implementation of the Site Restoration and Revegetation\nPlan and, after the lifespan of the Project, a Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan. MM SOILS-3\nwould require that topsoil, including desert pavement in rare instances where it is well developed, be\nproperly salvaged and reused on site where feasible, and not mixed with subsoil. Topsoil includes the\nnative seedbank, fertile islands, soil nutrients, organic matter and microbial communities needed for soil\nproductivity. MM SOILS-3 along with implementation of restoration would reduce effects, but effects\nwould remain adverse. Once soil disturbance has occurred, restoring productivity would be difficult for a\nlong time (i.e., decades to a century or longer).\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nThe total acreage of soils impacts from cumulative projects could be substantial, exceeding 15,000 to\n20,000 acres including the Project, transmission facilities, additional solar projects, and the Pumpkin\nHollow Copper Mine Open Pit Development Project (expansion project). Impacts from cumulative\nprojects could contribute to adverse effects (e.g., soil erosion and loss of topsoil). Exposure of bare soil\nwould increase erosion and sedimentation from wind and water across a larger area along the east side of\nthe Mason Valley. All cumulative construction projects that disturb more than 1 acre of land would be\nrequired to comply with the Construction Stormwater General Permit, requiring preparation and\nimplementation of a SWPPP. Erosion control BMPs in the SWPPP would minimize erosion, thus\nreducing cumulative effects.\n\nEach project would also contribute to the loss of soil productivity and, thus, could contribute to an\nadverse effect on soil productivity in the region. The Project would also contribute to this effect.\nMeasures to conserve topsoil and implement restoration would reduce effects, but the Project may still\ncontribute to an overall adverse impact on loss of soil productivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.4.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\n**Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Decommissioning Impacts**\nUnder this alternative, the native soil impacts from discing and/or grading would be reduced from\napproximately 64 percent of the application area to approximately 35 percent in total. Soil erosion from\nwind and water could still occur but would be reduced. The same Western Solar Plan PDFs, the CRMP\nSOPs, and MMs as identified for the Proposed Action would be applicable to reduce and minimize\nadverse effects to soils. The primary advantage of this alternative would be that soil productivity impacts\nwould be reduced as compared with the Proposed Action, resulting in approximately 1,800 acres of soil\nproductivity loss as compared with an estimated 3,420 acres under the Proposed Action. Impacts would\nbe reduced through application of MMs to salvage and reuse topsoil as well as through restoration efforts.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nCumulative impacts would be similar to those described for the Proposed Action in terms of the potential\nfor an overall cumulative impact to soils in the region, particularly from the loss of soil productivity. The\nProject under this alternative would still contribute to an overall loss of productivity, but the contribution\nwould be reduced as compared with that of the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.4.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nThis alternative is limited to the use of supplemental access routes during construction. The routes would\nserve to reduce the concentration of construction traffic on East Walker Road, in particular. Under\nAlternative 2, no new ground disturbance or upgrades to the roads are anticipated and, thus, no new\nimpacts to soils would occur beyond those described for the Proposed Action. Construction, O&M, and\ndecommissioning of the primary access road, the solar site, and the gen-tie would be the same as for the\nProposed Action, with the same measures (i.e., MM SOILS-1, MM SOILS-2, and MM SOILS-3, Western\nSolar Plan PDF SR2-1, and the CRMP SOPs 4 and 7) required to reduce impacts. Cumulative impacts\nwould also be the same as described for the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.4.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-Tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\nImpacts under this alternative would be the same as for the Proposed Action; however, reducing the gentie alignment from 24.1 miles to a 0.54-mile-long spur with a new switching station under Greenlink\nWest, immediately east of the solar site, would reduce overall soil disturbance. Disturbance for the gen-tie\nwas estimated at 104 acres. Under this alternative, the gen-tie and switching station would impact\n11.8 acres, a 92-acre decrease. Given the solar site comprises the majority of the soil impacts and would\nnot change under this alternative, impacts would still be adverse as described for the Proposed Action.\nWestern Solar Plan PDFs and MMs would also apply to reduce effects, but both Project impacts to soil\nproductivity and cumulative contributions would be assumed to remain adverse, although reduced\ncompared with the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.4.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the BLM would not issue ROW grants or special use permits, and the\nProject would not be constructed. Surface disturbance would not occur, and soils resources would not be\naffected.\n\n**_3.4.4.7 Relevant Required Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP_**\n**_Standard Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nProgrammatic design features from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project would\ncomply with the following PDFs to minimize impacts to soils:\n\n-  SR 2-1\n\n\n-----\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nSOPs from the CRMP (BLM 2001) are listed in Appendix B. The following SOPs would minimize\nimpacts to soils:\n\n-  Soil, Watershed, and Air SOPs 4 and 7\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans, required by the BLM ROW grant, would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize impacts to soils:\n\n-  Dust Control and Air Quality Plan (Draft is available on the Project website)\n\n-  Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan (Draft available on the Project website)\n\n-  Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts on soils:\n\n**MM SOILS-1: Construction Phasing**\n\n_(Applicable to the Proposed Action, Alternative 2, and Alternative 3)_ The Applicant shall incorporate\nphasing of the development during final design, in order to minimize the amount of area of un-stabilized\nsoils at a time. Phasing would include ground disturbance and development of roads, pads, and\ninfrastructure in not more than 1,000-acre areas at a time. The areas would be built to the point that array\nposts are installed, and then the ground stabilized, before opening the next 1,000 acres of development.\nPhasing shall be identified in the final design plans provided and approved by the BLM, prior to NTP.\n\n**MM SOILS-2: Design Level Geotechnical Investigation**\n\nA design level geotechnical investigation shall be prepared prior to construction. The investigation shall\naddress soil hazards as well as design of posts and foundations for corrosivity and hardpan soil horizons.\nThe recommendations of the design-level geotechnical investigation shall be implemented and provided\nin the final design plans provided and approved by the BLM, prior to NTP.\n\n**MM SOILS-3: Soil Preservation and Topsoil Salvage**\n\nThe following measures shall be implemented to preserve where possible and salvage topsoil:\n\n(1) Determine the extent of the salvage operation. Excavate the topsoil carefully using machinery like\nbackhoes or excavators, ensuring minimal disturbance to the underlying layers.\n\n(2) Create designated stockpile areas for each soil type identified during the site assessment. Separate\nthe salvaged topsoil into distinct piles based on their properties and characteristics. This shall\nenable better management and targeted use of the soils later.\n\n(3) Store the sorted topsoil in a well-organized manner, using appropriate measures to protect it from\nerosion, wind, and excessive moisture. Covering the stockpiles with tarps or using windbreaks\ncan help maintain soil quality and prevent loss through wind erosion.\n\n(4) When using for reclamation, follow best practices for soil preparation, such as incorporating\norganic matter or soil amendments, as necessary.\n\n**_3.4.4.8 Irreversible or Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nSoil impacts associated with the Project are related to long-term loss of productivity and losses from wind\nand water erosion. Under all alternatives, some degree of soil productivity would be lost for up to 100 or\nmore years, but given implementation of the Decommissioning and Reclamation Plan, soil productivity\nwould not be irretrievably lost. Even after application of mitigation, some erosion is anticipated as a\nresidual effect, as is the loss of soil productivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.5 Cultural Resources\n\n**3.5.1 Introduction**\nCultural resources include prehistoric and historic-era archaeological sites, historic buildings, and\nstructures (architectural), as well as the locations of significant historical events. Cultural resources are\nphysical features (both human-made and natural) associated with past human activities or past and extant\ncultures that are, in most cases, finite, unique, fragile, and non-renewable.\n\nUnder NEPA, impacts on all cultural resources are considered regardless of their eligibility for inclusion\nin the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or local historical designation. Cultural resources are\ncategorized as one of the following types: prehistoric archaeological resources; ethnographic resources; or\nhistoric-period archaeological and built-environment resources. Cultural resources also include sacred\nsites and other places of traditional cultural importance, including traditional cultural properties (TCPs),\nthat are associated with the cultural practices or beliefs of a living community. Cultural resources are\nevaluated for their eligibility for the NRHP under Title 54 U.S. Code (USC) section 300101 et. seq.,\ncommonly known as the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA), and Title 54\nUSC section 306108, commonly known as Section 106 of the NHPA. NRHP-eligible cultural resources\nare also called historic properties.\n\nUnder Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, compliance with NEPA necessitates a\nthorough assessment of potential impacts on cultural resources, including consultation with relevant\nparties to identify and mitigate adverse effects on historic properties. The BLM has chosen to fulfill its\nobligations under Section 106 of the NHPA for the Project by using the process outlined in 36 CFR\nsection 800.8(c), known as \"Substitution,\" rather than the traditional Section 106 review process, for this\nProject. \"Substitution\" allows federal agencies\u2019 officials to \u201cuse the process and documentation required\nfor the preparation of an Environmental Assessment/Finding of No Significant Impact or an EIS/ROD to\ncomply with Section 106 in lieu of procedures set forth in 36 CFR 800.3 through 800.6\u201d (36 CFR \u00a7\n800.8(c)(1)). The agency official must notify the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office\n(SHPO)/Tribal Historic Preservation Office and the ACHP in advance of its intentions. The BLM sent\nnotification of its intent to use Substitution to the SHPO, ACHP, and Native American Tribes on April\n14, 2023. More information on the regulatory requirements of the Substitution process, and how this\nProject complies, are provided in Appendix D.\n\n**3.5.2 Analysis Area**\nAs defined under Section 106 of the NHPA, the area of potential effects (APE) is a geographic area or\nareas within which impacts from an action may affect historic properties (36 CFR 800.16(d); 36 CFR\n800.4(a)(1)). The BLM, as the lead agency for Section 106 compliance, defined the APE in consultation\nwith the SHPO and other parties.\n\nThe analysis area considered two types of APEs, the direct APE and the visual, auditory, and atmospheric\n(VAA) APE, as shown in Figure 3.5-1. The direct APE conforms with the Project area while the VAA\nAPE is defined as the Project area plus a 5-mile area extending from the Project area. The VAA APE was\ndefined consistent with IM NV-2021-006 and the guide for Defining a Visual Area of Potential Effects to\nHistoric Properties on BLM Lands in Nevada. The 5-mile VAA APE corresponds visually with the\nestablished \"foreground and foreground/middleground\" area. While it is possible that the Project may be\nvisible beyond 5 miles, its visibility beyond 5 miles has been determined not to be an intrusion that could\naffect historic properties or other cultural resources. This analysis area accounts for potential physical;\nVAA; as well as cumulative impacts from implementation of the Project. The direct APE encompasses\napproximately 6,924 acres; the VAA APE is approximately 317,200 acres.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.5-1 Proposed Area of Potential Effects (APE)**\n\n**Note:** The direct APE as shown in this figure includes previous versions of the gen-tie alignment and a northern\naccess road option. The APE was established, and surveys conducted prior to realignment and preliminary design\nmoved the gen-tie to its current position. The realignment was subsequently surveyed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.5.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.5.3.1 Cultural Setting_**\n\n**Prehistoric Period**\nEvidence of human occupation first appears in the record in the Great Basin starting around 11,000 years\nbefore common era (BCE). Early occupants were hunter gatherers who formed small populations of\nhighly mobile foragers during the end of the Pleistocene. In addition to hunting, Paleoindian/Paleoarchaic\ngroups in the Great Basin pursued a broad subsistence strategy consisting of waterfowl, lagomorphs, and\nplant foods (Beck and Jones 1997). Pluvial lakes dried up from around 6,500 BCE to 3,000 BCE and\nsustenance shifted to seeds and other plants, as evidenced by ground stone artifacts. A cooler wet climate\nprevailed from 3,000 BCE through 500 common era (CE), reestablishing pluvial lakes. Larger mammals,\nespecially mountain sheep, appear to be the preferred game choice in upland settings, although deer,\nrabbit, and, occasionally, bison were taken (Aikens and Madsen 1986). From 500 to 1400 CE, human\npopulations in the central and western Great Basin, which includes the Project area, practiced a\ncontinuation of adaptive strategies from earlier periods. Throughout the archaic period and into the\nhistoric period, the regional archaeological record in the western Great Basin reflects variations in huntergatherer adaptations. The late prehistoric period is characterized by human use of small triangular arrow\npoints (e.g., desert side-notched, cottonwood triangular) and brownware pottery, called Intermountain\nBrownware. By the time of contact with non-Indigenous cultures, the present ethnographically known\nNumic-speaking bands were well established in the western Great Basin, including in the Project region.\n\n**Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric**\nThe Project is within a greater region that includes the Newe (Western Shoshone) to the east, the Numa\n(or Northern Paiute) within the Project area, and the Wa She Shu (Washoe) to the west.\n\nThe Newe (or Western Shoshone) territory traditionally covered a large swath of land from Death Valley,\nCalifornia, to the south, up to Idaho and Utah in the north-northeast, and including much of central\nNevada (ITCN 1976). Newe bands were flexible in membership and distribution. In central Nevada, the\nNo-ga\u2019ie near Duckwater and Pi-at-tui\u2019ab-be in Big Smoky Valley were documented by Powell and\nIngalls in 1873 as Newe bands with ties to south-central Nevada (Bengston 2003; ITCN 1976). Julian\nSteward\u2019s work with Western Shoshone reported additional bands in Beatty (Ogwe-pi), the Belted Range,\nand Lida, Clayton, and Death Valleys (Steward 1938).\n\nThe Numa (or Northern Paiute) traditionally occupied the western third of the Great Basin region\nstretching from the Owens Valley in California through Nevada and into southern Oregon and Idaho\n(ITCN 1976b; Bengston 2003). The Numa language and traditions share many commonalities with the\nNewe and Nuwuvi to the east but are distinct from the Washoe and California groups to the west. Similar\nto all Great Basin groups, the Numa territory was composed of many overlapping and spatially fluid\nhomelands occupied by bands of varying size and composition. There were at least six distinct bands in\nthe southern portions of Numa territory, including the Kootzagwae of Mono Lake, Pagwewae and Agiwae\nof Walker Lake and lands east, Taboosewae of Mason and Smith Valleys, Toewae of the Carson Sink,\nand Kooeyooewae of Pyramid Lake (Stewart 1939; Johnson 1975; ITCN 1976b).\n\nThe Wa She Shu (or Washoe) inhabited and continue to reside in the area along the eastern Sierra Front to\nthe west, the Pine Nut and Virginia ranges to the east, Honey Lake in the north, and Sonora Pass in the\nsouth. Early occupation of the region by the Washoe is supported ethnographically and oral traditions tell\nthat the Washoe did not travel to this place, but rather have always been there. Linguistic studies show\nthat the Washoe language is drastically distinct from that of their neighbors (ITCN 1976c).\n\n**Historic Period**\nNevada\u2019s historic period began in the 1700s when Spanish explorers passed through present-day southern\nNevada searching for a route to connect settlements in New Mexico with those in California. Exploration\nof central Nevada did not begin in earnest until 1826, when Spanish authorities opened the territory to fur\ntrapping. The Spanish province of Alta California, which included present-day Utah and Nevada,\nbelonged to Spain until 1822, then to Mexico, but was ceded to the U.S. in 1848 at the end of the Mexican\n\n\n-----\n\nAmerican War. In 1849, the discovery of gold near Sutter\u2019s Mill, California, spurred westward migration.\nIn 1849 alone, the California Trail saw as many as 25,000 travelers. Emigrants did not typically pass\nthrough the central portions of Nevada until the 1860s (McBride 2002).\n\nThe Comstock strike of 1859 changed perceptions of Nevada from \u201cpass through\u201d country to a region of\neconomic potential (De Quille 1877; McBride 2002). Miners who initially failed to strike it rich in\nCalifornia came to the Comstock area near the Carson Valley to work the strike. Soon thereafter, the\nReese River District of central Nevada began to attract interest. In 1864, Nevada was admitted to the\nUnion as the 36 [th] state. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, mining continued to\ndevelop throughout western Nevada, necessitating the growth of railroad networks in the region. The four\nmajor railroads in the area were the Tonopah & Goldfield Railroad, the Las Vegas & Tonopah Railroad,\nthe Tonopah & Tidewater Railroad, and the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad. Towns such as Yerington,\nHawthorne, Luning, and Mina, either already existed or cropped up along the railroads and were initially\nassociated with mining and/or railroad stations. Many of these towns persisted through the mid-twentieth\ncentury and some remain inhabited today. As mining and railroad growth halted throughout the region\nduring the mid-twentieth century, towns fostered and relied on other industries such as agriculture;\nmilitary infrastructure and training; recreation and tourism; gambling; and hospitality, all of which\nbecame major sources of economic growth for communities in western Nevada. The closest populated\narea to the solar site, the city of Yerington, started as a trading post in 1871 and was originally named\nPizen Switch. The town was renamed Greenfield, and then \u201cYerington,\u201d for Henry M. Yerington,\nsuperintendent of the Virginia & Truckee Railroad from 1868 to 1910, in a failed attempt to woo him into\nbringing a rail spur to the town. Over the years, the area\u2019s focus turned to farming as well as copper\nmining. The Anaconda Copper Company extracted 360 million tons of copper from its open pit mine\nbetween 1952 and 1978 (Travel Nevada, n.d.).\n\n**_3.5.3.2 Survey Methods_**\n\n**Direct APE**\nIn order to establish the affected environment and determine existing cultural resources (including historic\nproperties) that could be physically impacted by the Project, a Class I cultural resources inventory and\nreport and a Class III cultural resources survey and report were completed (Stoner and Catacora 2023).\nAll background research and fieldwork were completed by ASM Affiliates in accordance with the\nSecretary of the Interior\u2019s Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation, the standards found\nwithin BLM Manual 8110, and the BLM Nevada State Office\u2019s Guidelines and Standards for\nArchaeological Inventory (Sixth Edition).\n\nThe Class I cultural resources inventory, conducted prior to the Class III intensive survey, identified\nnumerous archaeological and historical sites within the direct APE. Data sources for the research included\nthe Nevada Cultural Resources Information System (NVCRIS) database; files from the BLM CCDO;\nhistoric General Land Office (GLO) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps; the NRHP database; and\npublished and unpublished tribal ethnographic overviews and TCP studies.\n\nA Class III cultural resources inventory was required for the direct APE for the Proposed Action and\nalternatives that were carried forward into detailed analysis. The Class III survey was performed by ASM\nAffiliates in 2022 and 2023. If portions of the direct APE were surveyed for cultural resources by a\nqualified professional in the last 20 years to Class III standards, those areas were not resurveyed. All\npreviously recorded sites in those areas were revisited and updated, as necessary. An approximately\n1,000-foot section of the gen-tie on Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW) property near the Fort\nChurchill substation was not surveyed due to access, but it has been reportedly surveyed for Greenlink\nWest (BLM 2023).\n\nCultural resources identified during the Class III inventory were evaluated for eligibility for listing in the\nNRHP by ASM and the BLM, within an appropriate historic context, using the four criteria of\nsignificance and the seven aspects of integrity. In order to be eligible for listing in the NRHP, a cultural\nresource must possess both historic significance and sufficient integrity to convey that significance (36\nCFR \u00a7 60.4). Significance must be demonstrated under one or more of the following four criteria: A)\n\n\n-----\n\nassociated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; B)\nassociated with the lives of persons significant in our past; C) embodies the distinctive characteristics of a\ntype, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic\nvalues, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual\ndistinction; or D) have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.\nCultural resources that are significant under the criteria must also retain sufficient integrity to be eligible\nfor listing in the NRHP. The seven aspects of integrity include location, design, setting, materials,\nworkmanship, feeling, and association.\n\n**Visual, Auditory, and Atmospheric APE**\nA records search and literature review (Class I Inventory) of the VAA APE was also conducted by ASM.\nA visibility analysis was performed using ArcGIS Spatial Analyst to identify all areas that would be\nvisible from the Project out to a distance of 5 miles. The visibility analysis identified where the Project\nwould be visible if there were no vegetation or structures to screen the Project components (i.e., bare earth\nanalysis).\n\nHistoric properties identified in the records search that a) were within the VAA APE, b) had potential\nvisibility based on the visibility analysis, and c) where visual, auditory, or atmospheric changes could\nimpact the integrity of the resource, were subject to visual field inspections and assessment. Visited\nhistoric properties were photographed from selected sensitive-viewer observation points, which were\nidentified within the historic property or at the boundary of the historic property. The photographs were\nused to prepare visual simulations and to complete BLM visual assessment forms to aid in the analysis of\neffects (Stoner and Catacora 2023a).\n\n**_3.5.3.3 Resources Found_**\n\n**Cultural Resources within the Direct APE**\nASM documented 80 previously unrecorded sites within the direct APE and revisited/re-evaluated six\npreviously recorded sites. Of these 86 sites, 72 are historic-era sites, nine are prehistoric era sites, and four\nare multi-component sites (Stoner and Catacora 2023). The nine pre-historic sites are all lithic scatters.\nThe 72 historic-era sites focus mainly on prospecting and mining, transportation and infrastructure\nresources including roads, railroads, and transmission lines, unassociated historic refuse deposits, a\nranching-related well and trough, and cadastral markers (Stoner and Catacora 2023, 2023a, and 2023b).\n\nThe BLM has determined that seven of the 86 sites within the direct APE are eligible for listing in the\nNRHP (i.e., are historic properties) and is seeking SHPO\u2019s concurrence. The following table identifies the\nseven historic properties by category and type of site. The remaining sites have been recommended as not\neligible for listing in the NRHP. The SHPO is also being requested to provide concurrence on the \u201cnot\neligible\u201d determinations.\n\n**Table 3.5-1: Libra Solar Project Historic Properties within the Direct APE**\n\n\n\n|Site number|Site description|NRHP determination|SHPO concurrence|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|26LY3165|Reese River Wagon Road|Eligible under Criterion A|Pending|\n|S3327|Southern Pacific Railroad|Eligible under Criterion A|Pending|\n|S3328|US Highway 95A [US95A]|Eligible under Criterion A|Pending|\n|26LY1450|Wabuska Drain Segments|Eligible under Criterion A||\n\n\n-----\n\n|Site number|Site description|NRHP determination|SHPO concurrence|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|26LY3287|Multi-component artifact scatter with features|Eligible under Criterion D|Pending|\n|LY3288|Paleoindian lithic scatter|Eligible under Criterion D|Pending|\n|LY3289|Paleoindian lithic scatter|Eligible under Criterion D|Pending|\n\n\n**Resources within the VAA APE**\nThe VAA APE included the area within 5 miles of the proposed Project. The records search and literature\nreview of the VAA APE identified 706 cultural resources within 5 miles of the proposed Project,\nincluding resources also within the direct APE. Of the sites within the VAA APE, 39 resources were\npreviously determined eligible for the NRHP under Criterion A, B, C and/or D. Sixteen of these 39\nhistoric properties were found to not have VAA components (i.e., setting components) that support their\neligibility determinations or listing and thus are not considered further in the VAA analysis. Between\nMarch 20 and 31, 2023, ASM conducted field visits of the remaining 23 historic properties to assess if\nthey have line-of-site viewsheds of the Project that would be affected or may have setting components\ncontributing to their site eligibility. Eighteen of the 23 historic properties visited by ASM were found to\nhave either no direct line-of-sight to the Project area or do not have setting components that support their\neligibility. These 18 historic properties were not considered further in the VAA analysis.\n\nThe remaining six historic properties, summarized in Table 3.5-2 3.5-2, are in the\nforeground/middleground zones of the VAA APE and have setting components that support their\neligibility, and thus are the six resources considered for potential VAA impacts in Section 3.5.4.\n\n**Table 3.5-2: Libra Solar Project NHRP- Eligible Sites within the VAA Area that could be Affected**\n**by the Project**\n\n|Site number|Site description|NRHP Status|\n|---|---|---|\n|26LY1450|Wabuska Drain|Eligible under Criterion A|\n|26LY2088|Y Hill|Eligible under Criterion A|\n|26LY2887/D357|Sagecrest Drive-In Historic District|Eligible under Criteria A, C and D|\n|26LY3165|Reese River Road, Refuse Scatter, and mining features|Eligible under Criterion A|\n|S3327|Southern Pacific Railroad|Eligible under Criterion A|\n|S3328|US Highway 95A [US95A]|Eligible under Criterion A|\n\n\n\nFour of the historic properties considered in the VAA APE are also in the direct APE, including Reese\nRiver Wagon Road (26LY3165), the Wabuska Drain (26LY1450), Southern Pacific Railroad (S3327),\nand US95A (S3328). The Wabuska Drain, Southern Pacific Railroad, and US95A have modernized\nfeatures. The Reese River Wagon Road site (26LY3165) consists of two segments of the historic wagon\nroad that were an important element of the local transportation network in the nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries, with a period of significance between 1859 and 1972. Y Hill (26LY2088) is the\nhistoric-era town marker for Yerington and consists of the \u201cY\u201d geoglyph with an historic-era refuse\n\n\n-----\n\nscatter. The \u201cY\u201d geoglyph overlooks the town and was created in the 1930s. It represents a pattern of\ndevelopment in the town of Yerington\u2019s identity, falling within the period of significance of 1860 to\n1935. 26LY2887/D357 (Sagecrest Drive-In Historic District) is a drive-in theater that opened between\n1952 and 1953 as the \u201cSagecrest Drive-In\u201d and was in operation until 1995, retaining much of its historic\nintegrity and its core structural components including a screen, ticket booth, and projection\nbooth/concession stand. These two historic properties, along with the Reese River Wagon Road, include\nthe integrity of the rural county settings in their eligibility contributions.\n\n**_3.5.3.4 Traditional Cultural Properties_**\nTo date, no TCPs have been identified. The BLM sought input about potential TCPs from Tribes that may\nbe affected by the Project through issuance of consultation letters under Section 106 consultation and\nthrough two workshops held with the Tribes as part of government-to-government consultation in June\nand July 2023.\n\n**3.5.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.5.4.1 Methods_**\n\n**Considerations**\nAs defined under 36 CFR section 800.5(a)(1) (Criteria of Adverse Effect), an adverse effect occurs when\na federal undertaking directly or indirectly alters any characteristics of a historic property that qualify it\nfor NRHP listing. An adverse effect on a historic property is not limited to physical destruction or damage\nbut may also include relocation of the property, changes in the character of the setting of the property, and\nthe introduction of VAA intrusions that alter the integrity of its setting. Impacts from a federal\nundertaking that result in an adverse effect on a historic property may also include reasonably foreseeable\neffects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time (i.e., cumulative impacts).\n\nCultural resources that are not eligible for listing in the NRHP warrant no further consideration under the\nNHPA.\n\n**Physical Effects**\nA Project that could cause the direct physical alteration of character-defining features of a historic\nproperty could result in diminished aspects of integrity (i.e., location, design, setting, materials,\nworkmanship, feeling, and association). The impact is assessed according to the extent that the degree of\nphysical alteration would constitute an adverse effect to the eligibility of the historic property under\nSection 106 of the NHPA (BLM Nevada and the Nevada SHPO 2012, chap. V). The seven historic\nproperties in the direct APE were assessed for potential for damage or loss from Project construction and\nO&M, in order to characterize effects.\n\n**VAA Effects**\nVAA effects result from changes to the scenic quality and/or value of the cultural resources from\nmodifications to the surrounding landscape. Where the setting is important, it must be determined if the\nproposed project would cause a VAA intrusion sufficient enough to diminish the characteristics of setting\nthat make the property eligible. Where it does not contribute to the eligibility of the property, the effects\nto that setting are not important considerations. Historic properties that are only important for their\ninformation potential (i.e., those that qualify under Criterion D) are not eligible for their setting and\ntherefore are not affected by visual, auditory, or atmospheric impacts. Therefore, only historic properties\nwithin the VAA APE that qualify under Criteria A, B, or C are analyzed for VAA impacts.\n\nIn order to assess affects, the visual simulations and visual assessment forms were used to understand the\ndegree of contrast and contextual changes to setting that the Project could have on the six identified\nhistoric properties with potential for VAA impacts. Where a historic property is sensitive to the rural\nsetting or context and the Project would have moderate or strong contrast and thus be a noticeable\nelement in the view from that resource, an adverse effect to the resource would occur.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.5.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction and O&M Impacts**\n_Physical Impacts to NRHP-Eligible Resources._ Construction activities could have physical impacts on\nNRHP-eligible resources through direct contact with the historic property that could cause damage or loss\nof the resource. The three known prehistoric NRHP-eligible resources (26LY3287 [multi-component\nartifact scatter with features], LY3288 [Paleoindian lithic scatter], and LY3289 [Paleoindian lithic\nscatter]) can all be avoided. These three historic properties have no Project facility development or ground\ndisturbance proposed in their vicinity. However, without the area clearly being identified for avoidance,\nconstruction activity could occur in the area and damage or destroy the historic properties. MM CR-1\nrequires that an Environmental Exclusion Area (EEA) and at least 500-foot buffer be established around\nthe three prehistoric Paleoindian lithic scatter historic properties. The measure also requires that the EEA\nbe completely removed from the Project footprint in the final engineering and design plans prior to\nconstruction, resulting in redefinition of the development area boundary and fence lines. The measure\nwould prohibit occupancy outside the established Project boundary. The implementation of the measure\nwould thus ensure avoidance of any direct, adverse physical effects on these three NRHP-eligible\nresources during both construction and O&M. During O&M, no new ground disturbance would occur,\nand these historic properties would continue to be fully avoided.\n\nProject construction and O&M would result in an adverse physical effect to one of the historic period and\nbuilt environment historic properties, Reese River Wagon Road (26LY3165), due to the proposed\nwidening and surfacing work on the road that would modernize the road and thus alter a defining\ncomponent of the historic property. This impact would be mitigated through implementation of MM CR2, which includes archival and documentary research, oral history interviews, and photo documentation to\ndevelop a historic context suitable for the development of an interpretive site with signage focusing on the\ntransportation theme associate with the historic road. Project construction and O&M would not have any\npotential for physical impacts on the other three historic period and built environment NRHP-eligible\nresources within the direct APE (i.e., Wabuska Drain, Southern Pacific Railroad, and US95A). The gentie crosses these resources but would not result in any physical alteration of them.\n\nPotential adverse physical effects on known or previously undiscovered cultural resources could occur\nfrom theft or vandalism during construction and O&M. Construction would likely deter the normal\nrecreational activity by the general public that currently occurs in the Project area; however, an average of\n400 construction workers could be on the construction site at a time. Construction of the Project could\nalso unearth, expose, or disturb previously unknown subsurface archaeological, historic, or Native\nAmerican resources eligible for listing in the NRHP, or otherwise important cultural resources that may\nnot have been apparent on the surface during the survey. Damage or loss of these types of resource could\nresult in an adverse physical effect. The Applicant would comply with the Solar PEIS PDFs CR1-1 and\nCR1-2, which require coordination with the BLM to minimize physical impacts to NRHP-eligible\nresources, including consultation with other federal, tribal, state, and local agencies. The measures also\nrequire implementing appropriate training/educational programs for the solar company workers, including\nthe construction workforce. PDF CR1-2 requires appropriate avoidance and protection measures for any\nunexpected discovery of cultural resources during construction and, potentially, archaeological\nmonitoring, which would be accomplished through the development of an Inadvertent Discoveries Plan.\nThe implementation of Solar PEIS PDFs CR1-1 and CR1-2 would minimize potential impacts to\npreviously undiscovered cultural resources during construction.\n\nDuring O&M, effects on cultural resources (including historic properties) from theft or vandalism caused\nby increased public access are not expected since the solar site would be fenced and secured. The Project\nwould not provide new public access to the areas known to contain archaeological resources. Effects from\nincreased erosion that could expose, transport, weather, and rebury archaeological, historic, or Native\nAmerican resources are also not expected. Stormwater flow volume and runoff rates downstream of the\nProject site would not increase following construction of the Project to an extent that it would result in\nadditional erosion beyond baseline conditions. Graded areas within the solar site would be sloped, with\nprotections to prevent the creation of rills or gullies in accordance with the design-level geotechnical\n\n\n-----\n\nevaluation, which is also necessary to protect the solar infrastructure (see Section _3.4: Soils_ ). Areas of\nerosion would be addressed early through MM WR-3.\n\n_VAA Impacts to NRHP-Eligible Resources_ . As identified in Section 3.5.3.3, six historic properties are\nconsidered in the VAA impact analysis. These historic period and built environment resources are visible\nwithin 5 miles of the Project site and the integrity of the historic setting is a key component of the\nresources\u2019 NRHP-eligibility. The following discussion addresses the potential for adverse auditory and\natmospheric impacts, as well as visual impacts to the integrity of the setting for these resources from\nconstruction and O&M of the Project.\n\nTwo of the historic properties within the VAA APE (Y Hill and the Sagecrest Drive-In) are beyond a\ndistance where auditory effects caused by the Project could occur (generally 75 feet). Wabuska Drain,\nU.S.95A, and the Southern Pacific Railroad would be crossed by Project construction; however, auditory\nimpacts would not be adverse since noise impacts from construction would be temporary and elevated\nnoise is already associated with these resources. Adverse auditory effects to NRHP-eligible resources\nwould not occur.\n\nAir quality in the area appears to be fairly good. The Project is designed to generate clean energy and as\nsuch would not substantially change the air quality. Construction of the Project would temporarily\nincrease pollutants, including dust and emissions from equipment during construction. This increase\nwould be localized to the area of the APE and occur during the construction of the Project only.\nAtmospheric effects from the proposed construction methodology are thus assumed to be negligible and\natmospheric impacts would not occur during O&M. Adverse atmospheric impacts to the historic\nproperties would not occur.\n\nWhile no adverse auditory or atmospheric impacts would occur to the six NRHP-eligible historic\nproperties, visual impacts could occur. The Project construction and O&M could have an adverse visual\nimpact on the Southern Pacific Railroad (S3327), U.S. 95A (S3328), and the Wabuska Drain (26LY1450)\n(built environment historic resources). The Project\u2019s gen-tie would be built over these sites, changing the\nvisual context and character of the sites by adding a new, visible modern element. Adverse visual effects\nwould also occur to Y Hill (26LY2088), Sagecrest Drive-In (26LY2887), and the Reese River Wagon\nRoad. For each of these three resources, the rural setting is an important element of their eligibility.\nRetaining good integrity of setting would mean the surrounding areas remain rural and undeveloped. The\nProject would be visible in the foreground/middleground from these resources and thus could alter the\nrural setting by introducing a modern element. The change in the integrity of the setting for these three\nhistoric properties would be considered an adverse effect. The following table summarize the visual\nimpacts to each of the six NRHP-eligible resources within the VAA APE.\n\n**Table 3.5-3: Analysis of Effects to Historic Properties in the VAA Analysis**\n\n\n-----\n\nMM CR-2 identifies the mitigation for reducing adverse visual effects to the integrity of setting for the six\nNRHP-eligible historic properties. Adverse effects would be mitigated by archival and documentary\nresearch, oral history interviews, and photo documentation to develop a historic context suitable for the\ndevelopment of an interpretive site with signage focusing on the themes of Community Development for\nthe Sagebrush Drive in and Yerington \u201cY,\u201d Transportation for the Reese River Wagon Road, US95A, and\nthe Southern Pacific Railroad, and Agricultural related infrastructure and water for the Wabuska Drain.\nThe measure is elaborated in the Draft Cultural Resources Mitigation Plan (Appendix D).\n\n_Other Cultural Resources_ . NEPA also requires consideration of impacts to other cultural resources that\nmay not be eligible for listing in the NRHP. There are 74 additional resources found within the physical\nimpact APE that could be adversely affected by the Project construction (and O&M). The PEIS PDFs\nCR1-1 and CR1-2 would reduce some impacts to these resources, but many may be damaged or destroyed\nduring construction. These resources, however, are not expected to provide meaningful data and\ninformation and their loss would not result in a loss of information important to the historic record.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nUnder the Proposed Action, decommissioning activities would entail removal of the solar arrays and\nassociated facilities and reclamation of the site to pre-Project conditions (to the extent practicable). The\nseven eligible sites in the direct APE would be addressed prior to the construction phase. Solar PEIS PDF\nCR3-3, which requires the Applicant to confine soil-disturbance activities to previously disturbed areas,\nwould be implemented during decommissioning. In order to ensure continued avoidance of the three\nprehistoric sites, MM CR-1 requires that the EEAs be re-established during decommissioning. No new\nphysical impacts would occur to Reese River Wagon Road. Solar PEIS PDF CR1-2, would also be\nimplemented, requiring appropriate training/educational programs for the solar company workers,\nincluding the construction workforce. Adverse effects would be avoided.\n\nThe six historic properties with their visual setting effected by construction and O&M would have a\npositive effect from planned decommissioning as their visual settings would revert to pre-Project\nconditions.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nThe loss of several resources from a particular ethnographic group or representing a particular time period\ncould result in significant impacts with respect to the information those resources possess. Other projects\nin the region could affect resources with similar information about a particular tribe or prehistoric or\nhistoric timeframe, resulting in a cumulative effect. Several cumulative projects in the area could or did\ndirectly and indirectly affect cultural resources. Cumulative projects could affect previously unknown\n\n\n-----\n\ncultural resources during construction, and the cumulative effect from the loss of these resources could be\nadverse.\n\nSeveral cultural resources located in the APE were determined eligible for the NRHP, but under Criterion\nD only, and do not have visual components associated with their eligibility contributions. The Project\ncould potentially adversely affect seven historic-period sites but would avoid the three prehistoric\narchaeological sites.\n\nGreenlink West would otherwise affect six of the historic-period resources in the same manner as the\nProposed Action, including Y Hill, Sagecrest Drive-In, Reese River Road, U.S. 95A, Wabuska Drain, and\nthe Southern Pacific Railroad. Should adverse effects occur from the Project, they would be cumulative\nbut mitigable through the Cultural Resources Mitigation Plan, under MM CR-2. The Project could also\nphysically affect previously unknown resources, which along with impacts from other projects, could be\nconsidered an adverse cumulative effect. The Applicant would comply with the Solar PEIS PDFs CR1-1\nand CR 1-2, which require coordination with the BLM to minimize cultural resources impacts, including\nconsultation with other federal, tribal, state, and local agencies. The other cumulative solar projects on\nBLM land, as well as Greenlink West and the proposed Greenlink North Transmission Project, would be\nrequired to implement similar measures to reduce potential impacts to cultural resources. With the\nimplementation of MM CR-1 and Solar PEIS PDFs CR1-1 and CR1-2, the Project's contribution to any\nadverse cumulative effect on cultural resources would be minimal.\n\n**_3.5.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nImpacts to cultural resources from construction and O&M activities under Alternative 1 would be similar\nto those described above under the Proposed Action because the locations of ground disturbance would be\ngenerally the same. Alternative 1 would limit traditional construction methods (i.e., disc and roll and\ngrading) to approximately 20 percent of the solar array blocks, which would decrease the acreage of\nsurface and subsurface disturbance. This reduction in disturbance would reduce the potential for impacts\nrelated to discovery of and damage to unknown subsurface archaeological, historical, or Native American\ntribal cultural resources eligible for listing in the NRHP. The impacts to the historic properties within the\ndirect APE would be the same as for the Proposed Action, with avoidance of the three prehistoric sites\nthrough Project MM CR-1, and implementation of the Cultural Resources Mitigation Plan under MM CR2 to address the physical impacts to Reese River Wagon Road. No physical effects would occur to the\nother three historic properties in the direct APE (Wabuska Drain, US95A, or the Southern Pacific\nRailroad). VAA impacts to the six historic properties considered under the VAA analysis would also be\nthe same as for the Proposed Action and would be mitigated through MM CR-2.\n\nDecommissioning impacts would be the same as under the Proposed Action. The same Solar PEIS PDFs,\nthe CRMP SOPs, MMs, and required management plans as identified for the Proposed Action would be\nimplemented under Alternative 1 to minimize adverse effects. Cumulative impacts to cultural resources\nwould be the same as for the Proposed Action, and the Project under this alternative is not expected to\ncontribute to a significant cumulative effect with implementation of the measures.\n\n**_3.5.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nUtilizing supplemental access routes to the Project solar site would have the same impacts to cultural\nresources as the Proposed Action. The proposed construction area, workforce, and schedule would be the\nsame. No new or greater impacts would occur from diverting some traffic along other routes to the Project\nsolar site because the routes have already been disturbed and are in current use, and no new disturbance is\nproposed. The same PDFs, MMs, and required management plans would be implemented to reduce\nadverse effects as for the Proposed Action. Cumulative impacts to cultural resources would be the same\nas for the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.5.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\nAlternative 3 would eliminate construction of the proposed 24.1-mile gen-tie line to be replaced with a\n0.54-mile-long gen-tie and switching station located under Greenlink West. The three prehistoric\narchaeological sites within the Project area would be subject to the same potential for impacts as under\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Proposed Action, but impacts would be avoided through MM CR-1. Reese River Wagon Road would\nalso be subject to the same impacts as described for the Proposed Action and those impacts would be\nmitigated through MM CR-2. Impacts to previously undiscovered resources would also be similar to\nthose under the Proposed Action and reduced through the Solar PEIS PDFs.\n\nThe Project\u2019s VAA impacts to historic significance of Y Hill, Sagecrest Drive-In, US95A, Wabuska\nDrain, and the Southern Pacific Railroad would be completely avoided by this alternative but would still\noccur as described for the Proposed Action for Reese River Wagon Road. Cumulative impacts to cultural\nresources would be the same as for the Proposed Action but somewhat reduced since the VAA impacts to\nY Hill, Sagecrest Drive-In, US95A, Wabuska Drain, and the Southern Pacific Railroad would be avoided.\n\n**_3.5.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the solar field, gen-tie line, battery energy storage system, and\nassociated linear facilities would not be developed. No ground disturbance would occur, and there would\nbe no alterations to the landscape. Therefore, there would be no impacts to historic properties or\nunevaluated cultural resources that are sensitive to visual changes to setting. Existing conditions in the\nanalysis area would continue.\n\n**_3.5.4.7 Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**_3.5.4.8 Solar PEIS Project Design Features_**\nPDFs from the Solar PEIS are listed in Appendix C. The Project would comply with the following PDFs\nto minimize impacts to cultural resources:\n\n-  CR1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 3-3\n\n**_3.5.4.9 Plans Required and Mitigation Measures_**\nThe following required plans apply to cultural resources:\n\n-  Cultural Resources Mitigation Plan\n\n-  Inadvertent Discoveries Plan\n\nThe Project would implement the following mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts on cultural\nresources:\n\n**MM CR-1: Prehistoric Site Environmental Exclusion Area (EEA).** An Environmental Exclusion Area\n(EEA) and at least 500-foot buffer shall be established around the three NRHP-eligible prehistoric sites\nwithin the Project application area (26LY3287, LY3288, and LY3289). The EEA shall be completely\nremoved from the Project footprint in the final engineering and design plans prior to construction,\nresulting in redefinition of the development area boundary and fence lines. The design engineers shall\ncoordinate with the BLM or consulting archaeologist to verify full avoidance. Occupancy outside the\nestablished Project boundary shall be prohibited. EEAs shall be re-established during decommissioning.\n\n**MM CR-2: Cultural Resources Mitigation Plan.** A Cultural Resources Mitigation Plan shall be\nprepared that shall address the one historic property that could be adversely impacted through physical\ndisturbance and VAA impacts (Reese River Wagon Road [26LY3165]), as well as the resources that\ncould be affected only by visual, atmospheric, and auditory effect (i.e., Y Hill [26LY2088], Sagecrest\nDrive-In [26LY2887], US95A [S3328], Wabuska Drain [26LY1450], and the Southern Pacific Railroad\n\n[S3327]). The plan shall include measures that include archival and documentary research, oral history\ninterviews, and photo documentation to develop a historic context suitable for the development of an\ninterpretive site with signage focusing on the themes of Community Development for the Sagebrush\nDrive in and Yerington \u201cY,\u201d Transportation for the Reese River Wagon Road, US Highway 95A, and the\nSouthern Pacific Railroad, and Agricultural related infrastructure and water for the Wabuska Drain.\n\n**_3.5.4.10 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nIrreversible or irretrievable impacts are those that cannot be reversed or recovered. Cultural resources are\ntypically fragile and finite resources. The Project and all alternatives would avoid direct and indirect\n\n\n-----\n\nimpacts to the three prehistoric-period NRHP-eligible sites, with MM CR-1\u2019s avoidance provisions. The\nphysical impacts to Reese River Wagon Road would be irreversible for the Proposed Action and all\nalternatives but VAA impacts to the Y-Hill, Sagecrest Drive-In, the Southern Pacific Railroad, US95A,\nand Wabuska Drain (under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 1 and 2) would be reversed when the\ngen-tie is decommissioned. Any significant damage or loss of previously undiscovered resources as well\nas the impacts to the cultural resources that are not eligible for listing in the NRHP would be irretrievably\nlost.\n\nResidual impacts would include physical changes to the historic character of Reese River Wagon Road,\nand setting impacts to Y-Hill, Sagecrest Drive-In, the Southern Pacific Railroad, US95A, and Wabuska\nDrain (under the Proposed action and Alternatives 1 and 2) even with mitigation. Otherwise, residual\nimpacts would not occur unless inadvertent damage to NRHP-eligible resources occurs during the Project\nconstruction or other phases. With the Solar PEIS PDFs, this scenario and resulting residual impacts are\nunlikely.\n\n##### 3.6 Native American Religious Concerns\n\n**3.6.1 Introduction**\nThis section focuses on cultural and religious concerns that are specific to Native Americans or to which\nNative Americans bring a distinct perspective. Regulations, policies, and laws pertaining to Native\nAmerican cultural and religious concerns include the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the\nNAGPRA, and Executive Order 13007.\n\n**3.6.2 Analysis Area**\nThe analysis area includes the area of disturbance for all Project components (including for the Proposed\nAction and alternatives), including the solar facility and all associated components, roads, collector lines,\nand the gen-tie line. It includes an area within 5 miles of the Project where the Project could influence\nNative American concerns.\n\n**3.6.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.6.3.1 Federally Recognized Tribes_**\nThe Project is within a greater tribal region that includes the Newe (Western Shoshone) to the east, the\nNuma (or Northern Paiute) within the Project area, and the Wa She Shu (Washoe) to the west. The\nfederally recognized Tribes that were contacted and provided an opportunity to comment or consult\nregarding this Draft EIS and for which government-to-government consultation is ongoing include the\nBridgeport Indian Colony, Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, Yerington Paiute\nTribe, Walker River Paiute Tribe, Yomba Shoshone Tribe, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, and Washoe Tribe\nof Nevada and California.\n\n**_3.6.3.2 The Western Shoshone, Northern Paiute, and Washoe_**\n\n**Territorial Boundaries**\nThe Numa (or Northern Paiute) is the primary ethnographic group in the Project area. They traditionally\noccupied the western third of the Great Basin region stretching from the Owens Valley in California\nthrough Nevada and into southern Oregon and Idaho (ITCN 1976; Bengston 2003). The Numa language\nand traditions share many commonalities with the Newe and Nuwuvi to the east but are distinct from the\nWashoe and California groups to the west. Similar to all Great Basin groups, the Numa territory was\ncomposed of many overlapping and spatially fluid homelands occupied by bands of varying size and\ncomposition. At least six distinct bands were in the southern portions of Numa territory, including the\nKootzagwae of Mono Lake, Pagwewae and Agiwae of Walker Lake and lands east, Taboosewae of\nMason and Smith Valleys, Toewae of the Carson Sink, and Kooeyooewae of Pyramid Lake (ITCN 1976;\nJohnson 1975; Stewart 1939).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Wa She Shu (or Washoe) inhabited and continue to reside in the area along the eastern Sierra Front to\nthe west, the Pine Nut and Virginia ranges to the east, Honey Lake in the north, and Sonora Pass in the\nsouth. Early occupation of the region by the Washoe is supported ethnographically, and oral traditions tell\nthat the Washoe did not travel to this place, but rather have always been there.\n\nThe Newe (or Western Shoshone) territory traditionally covered a large swath of land from Death Valley,\nCalifornia, to the south, up to Idaho and Utah in the north-northeast, and including much of central\nNevada (ITCN 1976a). Newe bands were flexible in membership and distribution. In central Nevada, the\nNo-ga\u2019ie near Duckwater and Pi-at-tui\u2019ab-be in Big Smoky Valley were documented by Powell and\nIngalls in 1873 as Newe bands with ties to south-central Nevada (ITCN 1976a; Bengston 2003).\n\n**Culturally Important Resources**\n**Overview.** The Northern Paiute believe that power ( _puha_ ) could reside in any natural object and that it\nhabitually resides in natural phenomena such as the sun, moon, thunder, clouds, stars, and wind. Any\nindividual could seek power for purposes such as hunting and gambling, but only shamans possessed\nenough to call on it to do good for others. Not all modern representatives of animal species were\nnecessarily supernatural, but occasionally, such a special animal was encountered. A rich body of myth\nand legend, the former involving the activities of animal ancestors, set values and taught a moral and\nethical code. Today, people remember parts of these old narratives and often mix them with various\nChristian beliefs (Advameg, Inc., n.d.).\n\n**Botanical Resources (Medicine).** Less serious illness was formerly treated with home remedies made\nfrom over one hundred species of plants. Regional plants still provide a source of home remedies and\ntraditional medicine.\n\n**Wildlife.** Wildlife has spiritual, cultural, and economic values to the Native American Tribes in the\nregion, including game and fish species.\n\n**Water.** Water is an essential prerequisite for life in the arid areas of the Great Basin. Bodies of water hold\nspiritual significance to the Northern Paiute, as well as wetland areas, as wetlands were sources of food.\nThe Project solar site would be developed primarily on alluvial fans at the base of the Wassuk Mountain\nRange. The gen-tie line would cross the Walker River near the Mason Valley WMA, which is an\nimportant area for waterfowl and other game species.\n\n**Geologic Features.** Black Mountain is a place of Native American spiritual significance. It also includes\nextensive archaeological resources and is a National Conservation Area.\n\n**Archaeological Resources.** Three prehistoric-era archaeological sites of Native American origin were\nidentified during cultural resources surveys. See Section _3.5 Cultural Resources_ for more information.\n\n**Native American Concerns Identified through Consultation**\nThe BLM began government to government consultation with potentially affected Tribes by requesting\nassistance in identifying any issues or concerns about the Project, including the identification of sacred\nsites and places of traditional religious and cultural significance that might be affected. Although no TCPs\nhave been identified by Tribes or by research of available information, an area of Native American\nReligious Concern, the Pistone-Black Mountain NCA, is on Black Mountain above a segment of the gentie. The Black Mountain/Pistone Archaeological NCA encompasses significant petroglyph sites and\nnumerous cultural artifacts including projectile points, rock features such as corals and hunting blinds,\nand habitation sites. The site is important to the Walker River and Yerington Paiute Tribes as well as\nother northern Paiute bands. During tribal consultation, the Black Mountain/Pistone Archaeological\nDistrict was expressed to hold a special spiritual energy that should not be disturbed. Generally,\narchaeological site types that are important to Native American Tribes include settlement sites, storied\nrocks (rock writing sites), and sites with rock features.\n\nAdditional Native American concerns expressed during tribal consultation include energy being emitted\nunder the gen-tie line that could be felt, often referred to as the \u201ccorona effect,\u201d big game species passage\naround and under the gen-tie line being potentially impacted by the \u201ccorona effect,\u201d and in general,\n\n\n-----\n\ncumulative effects from the Project gen-tie and Greenlink West and other proposed solar projects in the\nregion. The Walker River and Mason Valley WMA areas are within a State of Nevada hunting unit that\nwas also expressed to be of importance to the Tribes for antelope and mule deer.\n\n**3.6.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.6.4.1 Methods_**\nThe primary method to identify Native American Religious Concerns is tribal consultation and\ncoordination. Government-to-government consultation between the BLM and federally recognized Native\nAmerican Tribes is ongoing pursuant to the 1994 Government-to-Government Relations with Native\nAmerican Tribal Governments Executive Memorandum and the BLM Manual 1780. The BLM began\nconsultation by sending letters in early 2023 to invite Tribes as consulting agencies under NEPA for the\nProject. No Tribes requested to be consulting agencies; however, the consulting Tribes are still treated as\nsuch under NEPA, as the BLM has shared the preliminary project design, held specific meetings to gather\ninput during planning, and kept open communication. The BLM has held two workshops with Native\nAmerican Tribes, on June 26 and July 12, 2023 (see Chapter 4: Consultation and Coordination for more\ndetailed information). Additional workshops and meetings will be held if requested by a Native American\nTribe and tribal consultation would continue for the life of the Project. Additionally, the BLM has\nengaged with Native American Tribes through the NHPA Section 106 process, including consultation and\na site visit for geotechnical fieldwork (see Section _3.5: Cultural Resources_ for more information on\nSection 106 consultation and coordination). Input received from the Tribes is incorporated into this\nanalysis.\n\nIn addition to consultation efforts, historical context was developed based on the Class I cultural resources\ninventory to identify archaeological/historical sites, ethnographic overviews, and TCP studies. This effort\nidentified places significant to Tribes as reported in ethnographic literature and provides a background\nand a historic setting for Native American religious concerns identified during this process.\n\n**_3.6.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction and Operations and Maintenance Impacts**\n**Overview.** Impacts on Native American religious concerns can occur through the destruction or\ndegradation of important plant, animal, and water resources and/or the destruction of habitat and creation\nof impediments to the movement of culturally important wildlife. Impacts can also occur through the\ndestruction of culturally significant archaeological and historic resources, destruction of or disruption to\nTCPs, and alteration of significant spiritual geologic formations or geographic locations.\n\n**Botanical Resources.** The Project area is vegetated primarily by a Great Basin Salt Desert Scrub\ncommunity, best described as a _Sarcobatus baileyi_ community, commonly referred to as Bailey\u2019s\ngreasewood. Construction and O&M of the Project would disturb two vegetation types associated with\nBailey\u2019s greasewood. Limited evidence exists to support use by Native American Indian groups, unlike\nthe more common greasewood ( _Sarcobatus vermiculatus_ ), whose flowers are edible and which has been\nused in weaving objects, in making scrapers, arrow points, digging sticks, and in other uses (National\nPark Service (NPS), n.d.). During consultations, Native American Tribes did not express any particular\nconcern for loss of this habitat type, nor did they inform the BLM of any medicinal or important\nvegetation on the site. While construction and subsequent operation of the Project would render\napproximately 5,141 acres of lands inaccessible, the surrounding areas contain tens of thousands, if not\nhundreds of thousands, of acres of similar types of upland desert scrub habitat and vegetation.\nDevelopment of the access road and gen-tie would result in some additional losses of vegetation, totaling\napproximately 114 acres across over 7 miles of road and 24.1 miles of the gen-tie. These losses are not\nexpected to have adverse effects because the Project site does not appear to support rare medicinal or food\nsource plants that are unique.\n\n**Wildlife.** The solar site would have some impacts to common wildlife due to the loss of habitat. Wildlife\nwould likely be displaced to surrounding areas, where similar habitat is abundant. Concerns were raised\n\n\n-----\n\nduring meetings with the Tribes that the Project\u2019s gen-tie could generate noise that could deter big game\nfrom hunting areas near the Walker River, north of the Mason Valley WMA, which are important to the\nWalker River Paiute Tribe. Construction would generate some noise and disturbances that could occur\nduring hunting seasons, which could push big game away from the immediate area of construction\nactivity. The impacts would be short in duration (a few weeks at any given point) and localized. Hunting\nwould not be adversely affected since the area of noise impact would be limited. During O&M, the gentie is not expected to deter big game species, such as pronghorn antelope, or change game behaviors in the\nvicinity of the gen-tie near the Walker River. Few studies have been undertaken to understand if\ntransmission lines, due in particular to the noise they generate, are avoided by large game species such as\nmule deer and pronghorn. However, there have been anecdotal reports of pronghorns in the area, where\nthere are existing transmission lines (e.g., the LADWP line). Given the gen-tie noise would drop-off to\nambient levels within a few hundred feet, and the gen-tie siting near existing transmission lines, impacts\nto the hunting units are not expected to be adverse. The gen-tie access roads may also provide improved\naccess for hunters into hunting territories, which could be a positive benefit.\n\n**Water.** The Project solar site would be developed primarily on alluvial fans at the base of the Wassuk\nMountain Range and would have limited impacts on water bodies, natural springs, and groundwater and\nthus would also have limited impacts on these values. The gen-tie line would cross several landforms\nincluding foothills of the Wassuk Range and wetlands around the Walker River. Wetlands and springs can\nhold a spiritual significance as sources of life and sustenance. The proposed gen-tie was sited to avoid the\nMason Vallely WMA wetland areas. The northern end of the gen-tie would cross the Walker River\nthrough a riparian area and over open water. The gen-tie line would span the open water and poles would\nbe sited to minimize effects to riparian habitat. The CRMP Applicable to All SOP 10 requires\nimplementation of measures to reduce the potential for pollution or siltation of the Walker River and\nsurrounding areas. Adverse effects to water bodies and sources of water are therefore not expected. An\nanalysis of groundwater impacts from groundwater pumping for use by the Project showed that no\nimpacts to rivers, springs, or other groundwater users would occur (see Section _3.9: Water Resources_ ).\n\n**Geologic Features and Archaeological Resources** . Key tribal concerns included visibility of the gen-tie\nline as well as potential for workers to visit the Pistone-Black Mountain NCA, increasing human presence\nand increasing the potential for damage to archaeological and spiritual resources. The visual effects\nanalysis for cultural resources concluded that neither the Project solar site nor the gen-tie is readily visible\nfrom Black Mountain. The proposed gen-tie alignment is at least 2.5 miles west of Black Mountain and\nwould be sited at the base of a dry lake valley between steep volcanic slopes. It would be below the\nskyline and not discernible at this distance. Noise would also dissipate quickly with distance and is not\nexpected to have an effect on Black Mountain. The solar site would not be visible from Black Mountain\ndue to intervening topography. While a trail leads up to Black Mountain from east of the solar site, the\ntrail is extremely rugged and is not passable with passenger vehicles. It would require a long, strenuous\nuphill hike and thus is not expected to be visited with any frequency by workers.\n\nThree pre-historic period lithic scatters and multi-component sites were identified within the solar site\nduring surveys. These sites would be fully avoidable, and MM CR-1 would ensure no impacts through\nestablishment of an EEA around these sites. An Inadvertent Discoveries Plan would also be developed to\nensure that if any resources are encountered during construction, impacts to the resources would be\nminimized. Refer to Section _3.5: Cultural Resources_ for more information.\n\n**_3.6.4.3 Decommissioning Impacts_**\nThe Applicant would limit reclamation and decommissioning activities to previously disturbed areas and\nexisting access roads to the extent practicable. Consistent with a Decommissioning and Site Reclamation\nPlan and several PEIS PDFs and the CRMP SOPs, the Applicant would perform restoration and\nrevegetation of the Project site. Impacts on Native American issues of concern would be reduced as\nperennial plants and animals would be allowed to return over time; however, it could take decades to a\ncentury or more given the level of disturbance associated with the Project.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.6.4.4 Cumulative Impacts_**\nMany developments in the area, including the Project, would involve vegetation removal or changes to\nthe existing habitats, which could cumulatively affect populations of plant and game species important to\nNative Americans. Other proposed solar projects in the region are all located closer to tribal land and\ncloser to the Mason Valley WMA and, thus, would have more direct impacts than the Project. While\ncumulative impacts could occur, given the location of the Project solar site and the limited habitat and\nwildlife effects from the gen-tie, the Project\u2019s contribution to a cumulative impact on important\nvegetation and game species would not be adverse. Impacts to Black Mountain and other archaeological\nresources could also be considered to be cumulatively significant. The Greenlink West proposed\nalignment is located at higher elevations east of the Project, closer to Black Mountain and, thus, would\nlikely be more visible and audible than the Project\u2019s gen-tie, situated at the base of the mountain in a\nvalley. The Project, due to its location and the fact that it would not be visible or audible from Black\nMountain, would not contribute to cumulatively considerable impacts. The development of more\nextensive renewable energy, transmission, and mining along the east side of Mason Valley and Pumpkin\nHollow, however, would have the potential to result in a cumulative transformation of a natural area to an\nindustrialized area, which could have an adverse impact on ecological values tied to nature and the earth.\nThe Project would contribute to this potentially adverse impact.\n\n**_3.6.4.5 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nConstruction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts from Alternative 1 would be largely the\nsame as for the Proposed Action, except that more vegetation would be left in place under the solar array\nblocks. This approach would allow regrowth of plants during O&M and after decommissioning, reducing\nthe long-term effects to habitats and ecological systems and values. The same Western Solar Plan PDFs,\nProject MMs, SOPs, and management plans as identified for the Proposed Action would apply.\nImplementation of these measures would ensure restoration as best as possible and avoidance of known\npre-historic resources. Implementation of an Inadvertent Discoveries Plan would address any resources\nfound during construction.\n\n**_3.6.4.6 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nConstruction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts from Alternative 2 would be the same as\nfor the Proposed Action. This alternative utilizes supplemental access during construction. This\nalternative would make no changes to the Project elements or how they are constructed. The same\nWestern Solar Plan PDFs, Project MMs, SOPs, and management plans as identified for the Proposed\nAction would apply. Implementation of these measures would ensure restoration as best as possible and\navoidance of known pre-historic resources. Implementation of an Inadvertent Discoveries Plan would\naddress any resources found during construction.\n\n**_3.6.4.7 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\nAlternative 3 would also have similar construction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts as\nthe Proposed Action for the access road and the solar site. The impacts from the gen-tie would be greatly\nreduced since this alternative would eliminate the 24.1-mile-long gen-tie under Black Mountain and\nthrough the Mason Valley WMA. Instead, a 0.54-mile-long gen-tie would connect the solar site to the\nGreenlink West line through a new switching station. The gen-tie and switching station would be built\nwithin the alluvial fan areas directly to the east of the solar site, within the existing dedicated energy\ncorridor and below the mountains. The gen-tie and switch station would not be visible or audible from\nBlack Mountain and, thus, are not expected to have direct or indirect physical effects. Cumulative impacts\nrelated to the gen-tie would thus also be greatly reduced.\n\n**_3.6.4.8 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the solar field, gen-tie line, BESS, and associated linear facilities would\nnot be developed because the BLM would not issue the ROW grant. No ground disturbance would occur,\nand there would be no changes or alterations to the landscape. Therefore, there would be no impacts to\nNative American religious concerns. Existing conditions in the analysis area would continue.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.6.4.9 Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**_3.6.4.10 Western Solar Plan Project Design Features_**\nPDFs from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project would comply with the\nfollowing PDFs to minimize impacts to Native American religious concerns:\n\n-  CR1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 3-3\n\n**_3.6.4.11 Plans Required and Mitigation Measures_**\nThe following required plans apply to cultural resources:\n\n-  Cultural Resources Mitigation Plan (Draft available on the Project website)\n\n-  Inadvertent Discoveries Plan\n\nThe Project would implement MM CR-1 from Section 3.5 as well to minimize adverse impacts on\ncultural resources.\n\n**_3.6.4.12 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nIrreversible or irretrievable impacts are those that cannot be reversed or recovered. The loss of habitat and\nthe cumulative industrialization of the area would be an adverse effect but could be reversed after\ndecommissioning although it could take centuries. Residual impacts would not occur unless inadvertent\ndamage to Native American archaeological resources occurred during the Project construction or other\nphases. With the Western Solar Plan PDFs, this scenario and resulting impacts are unlikely.\n\n##### 3.7 Vegetation, Special Status Plants, and Noxious Weeds\n\n**3.7.1 Introduction**\nThe following sections describe the existing native vegetation communities, special status plant species\n(including cacti), and invasive and noxious weeds that are present within the Project area. Field surveys\nwere conducted in 2022 and 2023 to assess general vegetation characteristics, presence of special status\nplants, cacti density estimates, and invasive plant populations. The botanical resources survey followed\nthe protocol described in the BLM Carson City District Office\u2019s guidance (BLM Handbook 6840). The\nmethods and detailed results of these studies are documented in the Botanical Resources Report: Libra\nSolar Project (Phoenix 2022). Several regulations and laws apply to management of vegetation resources\nin the Project area, including the federal ESA, BLM Manual 6840 Sensitive Species Management, NAC\nchapter 527: Protection and Preservation of Timbered Lands, Trees and Flora, and Executive Order 13112\nInvasive Species.\n\n**3.7.2 Analysis Area**\nThe analysis area for vegetation communities comprises the entire Project site (which includes the solar\nsite, gen-tie, and access road) plus a 100-foot buffer, which was surveyed for botanical resources and\nnoxious weeds. For the cumulative effects analysis, the analysis area includes the Mason Valley and\nWassuk Range.\n\n**3.7.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.7.3.1 Topography and Climate_**\nThe Project is located within the Central Basin and Range ecoregion, which consists of northerly trending\nfault-block ranges and intervening drier basins. Valleys, lower slopes, and alluvial fans are either shrub-\nand grass-covered or shrub-covered. The Project site is situated along the lower part of a gently sloping\nbajada that extends up into the Wassuk Range, located approximately 6 miles to the east. The topography\nis flat, with areas of gently sloping terrain, alluvial floodplains, and small hills with an occasional bedrock\noutcropping. Numerous shallow washes and ephemeral drainages flow westward through the site.\n\n\n-----\n\nElevations across the site range from approximately 4,985 feet to 5,495 feet above mean sea level (amsl),\nwith the highest elevations in the east and the lowest elevations in the west. The climate of the Central\nBasin and Range is characterized by arid conditions and dramatic daily and seasonal temperature\nfluctuations.\n\n**_3.7.3.2 Vegetation Communities_**\nThe Project site has experienced some level of disturbance, with evidence of grazing, soil compaction,\nand OHV use. Numerous boreholes and spoils piles from exploratory mining between the 1920s and\n1960s occur throughout the Project area, including on the solar site. Many of these borings are visible in\naerial imagery. The southern portion of the solar site is bisected by a distribution power line and by Reese\nRiver Road and Old State Road 2C. Two-track unpaved roads occur throughout the site.\n\nVegetation is relatively sparse across the Project area, including the entirety of the solar site as well as\nareas adjacent to the access roads and within most of the gen-tie alignment. Some invasive plant species\nare present across the solar site. Natural vegetation communities consist primarily of Bailey\u2019s greasewood\n( _Sarcobatus baileyi_ ) shrubland alliance. Within this alliance, at least two associations were observed\nwithin the solar site: Bailey\u2019s greasewood \u2013 bud sagebrush \u2013 shadscale/James\u2019 galleta ( _Sarcobatus baileyi_\n_\u2013 Picrothamnus desertorum_ \u2013 _Atriplex confertifolia/Pleuraphis jamesii_ ) shrubland association (38.7\npercent) and Baileys\u2019 greasewood \u2013 Nevada ephedra ( _Sarcobatus baileyi \u2013 Ephedra nevadensis_ )\nshrubland association (55 percent). Community associations within the Bailey\u2019s greasewood shrubland\nalliance are considered less common due to the limited distribution of Bailey\u2019s greasewood. Little\ninformation regarding the distribution and extent of these vegetation types is available. Numerous\ndrainage features are present and contain desert wash communities vegetated by rubber rabbitbrush\n( _Ericameria_ _nauseosa_ ) shrubland alliance (0.3 percent), fourwing saltbush ( _Atriplex canescens_ ) shrubland\nalliance (1.8 percent), and North American Warm-Desert Xeric-Riparian Scrub (4.2 percent) (Peterson\n2008). Vegetation communities are shown in Figure 3.7-1.\n\nThe gen-tie, for the majority of its length (approximately 20.6 out of 24.1 miles) is entirely within\nscrub/shrub vegetation land cover types, similar to the solar site. The 3.5-mile segment in closest\nproximity to the Fort Churchill substation is either within or immediately adjacent to woody wetland\nvegetation cover types associated with the Walker River. More detailed information on vegetation\ncommunities and species observed within the study area is found in the Botanical Resources Report:\nLibra Solar Project (Phoenix 2022).\n\n**_3.7.3.3 Special Status Plants_**\nSpecial status plant species include State or federally listed as threatened, endangered, proposed, or\ncandidate species; BLM sensitive species; species protected under the NAC \u00a7527.010; and other at-risk\ntaxa tracked by the Nevada Natural Heritage Program (NNHP). Removal or destruction of State-protected\nflora species requires a special permit from Nevada Division of Forestry (NRS \u00a7 527.270). The BLM also\nhas a special policy regarding the salvage of cacti species.\n\nFive special status plant species have been observed within the Proposed Project site. Four taxa of special\nstatus plants were identified within the solar site, including Lahontan beardtongue ( _Penstemon palmeri_\nvar _. macranthus_ ), Nevada oryctes ( _Oryctes nevadensis_ ), sand cholla ( _Grusonia pulchella_ ), and Tonopah\nmilkvetch ( _Astragalus pseudiodanthus_ ). Species statuses are listed in Table 3.7-1 and observed locations\nare shown in Figure 3.7-2. Apart from one individual of sand cholla, no special status species were found\nalong the access road. Within the gen-tie alignment, approximately 250 individuals of sand cholla were\nidentified, consolidated along the northern portion prior to the alignment turning west over the Mason\nValley WMA; two individuals of Tonopah milkvetch were identified on sand dunes west of the Walker\nRiver, along the northern portion of the alignment; and approximately 3,500 individuals of Nevada\nsuncup ( _Eremothera nevadensis_ ) were found south of the Mineral County boundary and interspersed\nalong the southern portion of the gen-tie to the solar site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.7-1 Vegetation Communities within in the Proposed Project Solar Site**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.7-2 Special Status Plant Locations within the Study Area**\n\nSource: (Phoenix 2023, Fig. 9)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.7-1** **Special Status Plant Species Found within the Study Area**\n\n\n\n\n\n|Species|Conservation status|Habitat|Location within the study area|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Lahontan beardtongue (Penstemon palmeri var. macranthus)|BLM-S; G4G5T, S2|Diversity of habitats including washes, roadsides, and canyon floors, particularly on carbonate-containing substrates|Dry wash on northern boundary of the solar site|\n|Nevada oryctes (Oryctes nevadensis)|BLM-S; G3S2S3|Found in deep and loose sandy habitats of stabilized dunes, washes, and valley flats|Southern end of the solar site in areas of deep alluvial sand|\n|Sand cholla (Grusonia pulchella)|BLM-S, G3G4S3|Common desert scrub habitat types, including sandy to rocky flats and slopes|Scattered throughout the solar site and not concentrated in any one location|\n|Tonopah milkvetch (Astragalus pseudiodanthus)|BLM-S; G3QS2|Found in deep sandy substrates in desert communities|Southern end of the solar site in areas of deep alluvial sand|\n|Nevada suncup (Eremothera nevadensis)|BLM-S; G3S3|Found in vernally wet areas, on gravel, sandy, or clay soils, and it can somewhat tolerate alkali soils|Along the gen-tie alignment, just south of the Mineral County border|\n\n\nNotes:\nBLM-S = Bureau of Land Management sensitive species\nG = Global rank\nT = Subspecific or variety taxonomic level (used in conjunction with G rank)\nQ = Questionable taxonomy\nS = State rank (state population of a species, subspecies, or variety)\n1 = Critically imperiled; 2 = Imperiled; 3 = Vulnerable; 4 = Apparently Secure; 5 = Secure\nA numeric range rank (e.g., S2S3 or S1S3) is used to indicate uncertainty about the exact status of a\ntaxon.\nSource: (Phoenix 2022; 2023)\n\nAll species observed are BLM sensitive species and are on the list of Nevada Division of Natural Heritage\n(NDNH) at-risk plant species. Taxa considered at risk and actively inventoried by NDNH commonly\ninclude those with federal or other Nevada agency status and those with global and/or state ranks of 1 to\n3, indicating some level of imperilment. Sand cholla is also a protected cacti species under the BLM and\nNDOW. No State-protected flora has the potential to occur within the Project site. A complete list of all\nplant species identified during the surveys is included the Botanical Resources Report: Libra Solar Project\n(Phoenix 2022).\n\nOne other BLM sensitive species was evaluated for the potential to occur within the study area: Churchill\nNarrows buckwheat ( _Eriogonum diatomaceum_ ). This species is considered critically imperiled in Nevada\n\n\n-----\n\n(S1) by the NNHP. It occurs in specific locations within clay to silty diatomaceous deposits of the Coal\nValley Formation, with a variable volcanic cobble overburden. These soils are not present in the study\narea, and no suitable habitat was identified during literature review or field surveys. This species is not\nexpected to be present.\n\n**_3.7.3.4 Cacti_**\nTwo species of cacti were documented during the belt transects: grizzlybear prickly pear ( _Opuntia_\n_polyacantha_ var. _erinacea_ ) and sand cholla (described above in 3.7.3.3 Special Status Plants). No species\nof yucca were seen during the belt transects or other botanical surveys as the Project site is too far north\nfor yucca. The belt transects are used to extrapolate estimated densities and the total number of\nindividuals expected based on actual counts observed. The majority of cacti noted during surveys were\ngrizzlybear prickly pear, with an estimated total of 1,318 expected across the study area. Sand cholla were\nmuch less prevalent, at an estimated 35 of the total expected. All cactus sampled were less than 3 feet tall.\n\nAlong the gen-tie alignment, approximately 250 sand cholla were identified, as previously described.\nApproximately 25 grizzlybear prickly pear were observed. The results of the belt transect sampling for\ncacti are detailed in the Botanical Resources Report: Libra Solar Project (Phoenix 2022).\n\n**_3.7.3.5 Invasive Species_**\nSix invasive weed species were documented during the botanical survey of the Project solar site. Only\none, perennial pepperweed ( _Lepidium latifolium_ ), is listed as a noxious weed by the Nevada Department\nof Agriculture (NDA) (Category C). The other invasive weeds observed but not classified as noxious\ninclude cheatgrass ( _Bromus tectorum_ ), red brome ( _Bromus rubens_ ), halogeton ( _Halogeton glomeratus_ ),\nprickly Russian thistle ( _Salsola tragus_ ), and barbwire Russian thistle ( _Salsola paulsenii_ ). These other\nspecies, although not listed by the NDA, are of concern due to their ability to invade and dominate areas\nof ground disturbance. Of particular concern are the two brome grasses: cheatgrass and red brome. The\nProject site was remarkably free of cheatgrass compared to adjacent areas, where it forms a dense\nunderstory. However, cheatgrass was the most commonly recorded invasive species (32 plants per acre),\nfollowed by barbwire Russian thistle (2.41 per acre). The other species observed had densities of less than\n1 per acre.\n\nNo Category A noxious weeds were identified along the gen-tie. Halogeton, prickly Russian thistle, and\ncheatgrass were found throughout the gen-tie alignment. Some Saharan mustard ( _Brassica tournefortii_ ),\nwhich is Category B noxious weed, was identified north US 95A. Perennial pepperweed ( _Lepidium_\n_latifolium_ ) and tamarisk ( _Tamarix_ ) (both Category C noxious weeds) were found near the Walker River\nand by the northwestern terminus of the gen-tie alignment. More information on invasive species is found\nin the Botanical Resources Report: Libra Solar Project (Phoenix 2022) and the Botanical Resources\nAddendum: Libra Solar Project (Phoenix 2023).\n\n**3.7.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.7.4.1 Methods_**\nProject impacts on vegetation are analyzed as either temporary or permanent. Temporary impacts would\noccur during Project construction and O&M. Some temporary impacts would be short-term and include\nareas of disturbance that can be reclaimed and revegetated following Project construction, within 3 to 5\nyears. Long-term temporary impacts include those that would not prevent recovery following Project\ncompletion but would remain throughout the duration of the Project\u2019s O&M phase, such as vegetation\ntrimming or fugitive dust emissions. Permanent impacts would occur in areas that are paved or otherwise\nprecluded from restoration to a pre-Project state for a decade or more. All ground-disturbing activity\nwhere plants are removed by the roots are considered a permanent impact. The definition of a permanent\nimpact also reflects the slow recovery rates of plant communities in desert ecosystems.\n\nDirect effects to vegetation include damage or mortality to individual plants and an overall reduction in\nthe total number of plants as well as effects that result in the loss of total area, biodiversity, vigor,\nstructure, and/or function of vegetative habitat. Indirect effects are those that occur not as immediate\n\n\n-----\n\neffects of a Project-related action but are reasonably foreseeable consequences that would alter the\ncharacteristics or quality of a vegetative community due to changes in the surrounding conditions (e.g.,\nspread of invasive species, changes in temperature, fugitive dust, herbicide drift).\n\n**_3.7.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Native Vegetation Communities.** Under the Proposed Action, disk and roll and grading methods that\nremove, crush, and bury vegetation would occur across most of the Project site to develop the solar panel\narrays and other associated facilities. Vegetation would be permanently cleared from access roads as well\nas the footprints of concrete foundations for the inverter equipment, battery systems, substation, and\nO&M facilities. The gen-tie construction would require grading for the development of access roads and\ninstallation of tower foundations, with a total of 104 acres of permanent impacts. Improvements to Reese\nRiver Road would include widening from 15 to 24 feet and would permanently impact 10 acres of\nroadside vegetation. Other areas would be disturbed by temporary work areas, including laydown yards\nand conductor string locations along the gen-tie. In total, Project construction would cause the direct and\npermanent loss of up to 3,420 acres of native vegetation and the habitat that vegetation provides within\nthe Project area. CRMP SOP 6 (SOPs Common to All) requires minimization of disturbance to the\nminimum amount needed; however, disturbance is still needed.\n\nGrading, leveling, and disk and roll site preparation would remove vegetation (including root structures)\nand topsoil, resulting in high levels of soil compaction, and is expected to lead to permanent impacts to\nperennial vegetation, which could take decades to a century or more to recolonize the site even with\nrestoration efforts (S. M. Grodsky and Hernandez 2020; S. R. Abella 2010). Anywhere soil disturbance is\nincorporated into site preparation, impacts to vegetation would occur and could persist well past the\nanticipated 30-year Project duration (Abella 2010; Chambers et al. 2013; Copeland and Butterfield 2017;\nLovich and Ennen 2011; Lovich and Bainbridge 1999). Removal of native vegetation communities affects\necosystem functions such as wildlife cover, forage, migration corridors, species interactions, mycorrhizal\nassociations, nutrient cycling, soil retention, and carbon sequestration (Beatty et al. 2017; Grodsky et. al\n2020). Permanent vegetation loss would occur on up to 3,420 acres and is considered an adverse effect.\nConstruction of the gen-tie would permanently disturb 104 acres of native vegetation, including shrubland\nvegetation but also some areas of riparian or woody wetland vegetation within the final 3.5-mile segment\nextending to the Fort Churchill substation (approximately 15 acres). Restoration of temporary disturbance\nareas would be implemented in accordance with the BLM-approved standards and requirements outlined\nin the Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan and in accordance with CRMP SOP 18 (SOPs Common to\nAll).\n\nIndirect impacts from construction of the Project are likely to include the potential for proliferation of\nexisting and new invasive species within and outside of the Project area in adjacent undisturbed areas,\nwhich would result in a degradation of adjacent vegetation communities. Indirect impacts could also\ninclude generation of additional fugitive dust, which can impede photosynthesis and other metabolic\nprocesses of native plants, particularly along the access road. Increases in surface water runoff from the\nProject site could also affect hydrologic characteristics of these communities. The introduction of\ncontaminants into these downstream habitats could result from accidental release of fuels or other\nsubstances, such as herbicides and dust palliatives, used in the Project area. Herbicides could drift off site\nand impact native plant communities or suppress restoration efforts after Project completion.\n\nAn Integrated Weed Management Plan would be implemented to control the spread of invasive species in\nthe native plant communities of the Project area and adjacent areas. The plan would follow the Western\nSolar Plan PDFs, including PDF ER3-1, which requires implementation of principles of integrated pest\nmanagement and includes biological controls to prevent the spread of invasive species per the 2015 Final\nPEA Integrated Weed Management Plan (BLM 2015); tired from the 2016 PEIS for Vegetation\nTreatments Using Herbicides on BLM Lands in 17 Western States (BLM 2016), the National Invasive\nSpecies Council's Management Plan (NISC 2016), and a PUP. Air, Soils, and Water SOP 7 also requires\nnoxious weed control in upland and riparian areas. These measures would reduce potentially adverse\n\n\n-----\n\neffects. Western Solar Plan PDFs SR2-1 and AQC2-1, as well as MM AQ-1, require soil stabilization\nmeasures to minimize air quality impacts from wind-blown dust on site, minimizing the off-site impacts.\nMM WR-3 would include bank stabilization and erosion repair. Surface-water run-off patterns would be\nmanaged through the use of detention basins to capture sediment and reduce off-site flow velocities,\nwhich would minimize the potential for off-site erosion. Current wash patterns may shift as a result of the\nProject, but current sediment loads are high due to existing limited cover. Contaminants would be\ncontained through a SPCCP during and after construction to minimize the potential for off-site\ncontamination that could impact vegetation communities, and only approved dust palliatives that are\nknown to be habitat safe would be used.\n\n**Special Status Plant Species.** A few populations or individuals of sensitive plant species are in areas\nproposed for disturbance. Some of these areas would result in unavoidable impacts, in particular those\noccurrences within the proposed solar site development areas. Several locations of sand cholla and one\nlocation of Tonopah milkvetch would be permanently lost through direct removal or crushing during disk\nand roll, grading, and other construction activities. However, the majority of occurrences of Tonopah\nmilkvetch populations are located outside areas proposed for development or ground disturbance, so\ndirect impacts to these populations would be avoided. Sand cholla was observed during belt transect\nsurveys and is estimated at approximately 22 individuals within the solar site area of permanent\ndisturbance. Based on the distribution throughout the solar site, it would be expected that the density of\nsand cholla would be similar in undisturbed areas outside the solar site. Direct impacts on occurrences\nand habitat of Tonopah milkvetch and sand cholla would be adverse but would not be expected to\njeopardize the viability of either species in the region. Special status species could also be directly\naffected by the proposed access road improvements and construction of the gen-tie line. Only one\nindividual of sand cholla that could be impacted was identified during surveys of the road, and no other\nspecies were located. However, construction of the gen-tie could impact additional sand cholla, two\nindividuals of Tonopah milkvetch, and, potentially, a larger population of Nevada suncup. Direct impacts\non occurrences and habitat of sand cholla and Nevada suncup within the gen-tie would be adverse but\nwould not be expected to jeopardize the viability of either species in the region. Direct adverse effects on\nLahontan beardtongue and Nevada oryctes are not anticipated since all observations are located outside\nareas proposed for disturbance. Indirect impacts to special status plants from construction of the solar site\nand gen-tie, as well as access road improvements and Project-related use, would include potential\nintroduction, spread, and proliferation of invasive species. Herbicide drift and fugitive dust could also\nimpact adjacent populations.\n\nProject MM VG-2 would reduce impacts to rare plant populations, which includes pre-construction\nsurveys for special status species; avoiding individuals or populations where possible in areas proposed\nfor disturbance, particularly along the gen-tie alignment; seed collection of special status plants that\ncannot be avoided; restrictions on herbicide use within occupied habitat; and discussing avoidance of\nspecial status plants in a Worker Environmental Awareness Program (WEAP). Implementation of MM\nVG-2 would be required for any known locations of special status plant species or those discovered\nduring pre-construction surveys, and restoration of temporary disturbance areas would be implemented in\naccordance with the BLM-approved standards and requirements outlined in the Site Restoration and\nRevegetation Plan, including using collected seeds of special status plants in restoration efforts. Seed\nsources used for restoration of temporary impact areas should be free of Palmer\u2019s penstemon in order to\nprotect existing populations of Lahontan beardtongue within the Project site and vicinity. Western Solar\nPlan PDFs SR2-1 and AQC2-1 require soil stabilization measures to minimize impacts from wind-blown\ndust on nearby special status species individuals or populations. An Integrated Weed Management Plan\nwould be implemented to minimize impacts to habitat occupied by special status species as a result of\nweed infestations. Additional requirements for inclusion in the Integrated Weed Management Plan are\nprovided in MM VG-1 and include removal and monitoring of invasive species. The CRMP SOP 7 (Air,\nSoils, and Water) also requires noxious weed control in upland and riparian areas in coordination with\nother agencies. These measures would reduce potentially adverse effects; however, some disturbance to\nindividuals or populations may be unavoidable and impacts would remain adverse.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cacti.** Project construction would have direct and indirect adverse effects on cacti. Approximately 3,420\nacres of habitat for cacti would be permanently disturbed on the solar site, with an additional 104 acres\nfor construction of the gen-tie. Access road improvements would include already disturbed areas, with\napproximately 10 acres proposed for new permanent disturbance from widening, which could contain\nsome cacti. According to the results of the belt transect surveys, the estimated number of cactus\npotentially present across the solar site ROW is roughly 839. The majority of these cacti would be\nexpected to be grizzlybear prickly pear; however, 22 individuals could likely be the BLM sensitive sand\ncholla, and other species of cacti may have gone undetected during surveys. Approximately 250 sand\ncholla and up to 25 grizzlybear prickly pear that could be impacted were identified along the gen-tie\nalignment.\n\nPotential direct adverse impacts to cacti from the Project include mortality, morbidity, and disturbance to\nindividuals or populations (S.M. Grodsky, Tanner, and Hernandez 2020). Indirect impacts from increased\ninvasive species densities within the Project site and surrounding area could reduce growth and\nreproduction of cacti and increase the risk of fire, which cacti are not adapted to and cannot survive.\n\nCacti in areas of permanent disturbance where vegetation is removed (e.g., disk and roll site preparation,\ngrading for roads and gen-tie lines, O&M buildings) would be salvaged and transplanted across the site or\nsold, in accordance with Project MM VG-1, the Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan, and the BLM\nregulations (e.g., SOP 18 [Common to All]). Of the approximately 839 or more cacti that may be\nencountered on the solar site, an estimated 65 percent would be permanently lost. With implementation of\nMM VG-1, cacti in temporary disturbance areas would be avoided or transplanted out of the way and then\nreplanted at the site after construction. Some additional cacti would be lost for gen-tie and gen-tie access\nroad construction, within the estimated 104 acres of disturbance, along with at least one sand cholla along\nthe Project access road.\n\nThe cacti species found within the Project area are widespread, but they are long-lived and provide an\nimportant habitat for wildlife. The loss of up to 3,420 acres that contain cacti would be significant\nbecause even after Project decommissioning, these species would likely not occupy the site again for\ndecades to a century or more (S. R. Abella 2010). Implementation of MM VG-1 includes measures that\nwould reduce impacts and protect some cacti, such as by avoiding individuals where possible (particularly\nalong the gen-tie) and salvaging and relocating healthy individuals outside of the impact areas. Prior to\nconstruction, the BLM would be provided with the number of cacti, by species, in permanent disturbance\nareas that would not be salvaged for replanting in temporary disturbance areas. The BLM Nevada IM No.\nNV-2019-036 stipulates that forest products, which include cacti, \"will be sold at no less than their\nappraised price and/or the minimum price.\" The Applicant would pay for a plant permit per the BLM\nforestry regulations and according to the appraised price schedule currently in effect for all cacti\ndestroyed during construction, in accordance with MM VG-1 and the BLM regulations.\n\nLoss of cacti would still occur, and direct impacts to the majority of these plants within the Project area\nwould be adverse. An Integrated Weed Management Plan that limits invasion and spread by invasive\nplant species would be vital to conservation of the remaining cacti in the solar site. Additional\nrequirements for inclusion in the Integrated Weed Management Plan are provided in MM VG-1, as\ndescribed above for vegetation communities, and include eradication and monitoring of invasive species\nand salvage/transplant of individual cacti that are found within disturbance areas. CRMP SOP 7 (Air,\nSoils, and Water) also requires noxious weed control in upland and riparian areas in coordination with\nother agencies. These measures would reduce potentially adverse effects. Western Solar Plan PDFs SR2-1\nand AQC2-1 requires soil stabilization measures to minimize air quality impacts from wind-blown dust.\nProject MM PS-3 requires a Fire Prevention and Safety Plan/Management Plan to minimize the risk of\nwildfires caused by construction and O&M of the Project. Western Solar Plan PDFs WF1-1 and WF2-1\nalso require that solar developments be sited and designed to minimize the risk of fires and that fire\nprevention measures are implemented for the life of the Project in coordination with the BLM, including\ninspections, monitoring, a WEAP, and adaptive management protocols.\n\n**Invasive Species.** Invasive plant species are common throughout the solar site; however, because the\nlandscape is mostly undisturbed, the existing densities are low. The Project has a high potential to\n\n\n-----\n\nincrease invasive species densities and introduce other invasive or noxious weed species within areas of\nconstruction impacts, given the level of soil disturbance and vegetation removal proposed. Increased\ndensities of weeds on site would affect the surrounding landscape by modifying native plant assemblages,\nreducing biodiversity, increasing competition with native species including sensitive plants, altering\nhydrologic conditions and soil characteristics, and increasing fire hazards.\n\nThe treatment (mechanical or chemical) of invasive plant species and noxious weeds could result in\ninadvertent injury or mortality to native plants and special status species that are in close proximity. The\namount of herbicide needed to control weeds on the solar site after construction could also kill the\nremaining native seed banks in the soil that survived construction disturbance and impede the\nestablishment of new vegetation; however, establishment of new vegetation is unlikely given the use of\nthe disk and roll site preparation method. Many weed species actively germinate year-round, which would\nrequire year-round maintenance of the site. In the experience of the BLM, implementation of invasive\nspecies management plans is challenging due to rapid colonization of disturbed areas. If invasive species\nare managed, there is still a high likelihood that edge effects from the Project would increase invasive and\nnoxious weeds in the surrounding off-site areas.\n\nAn Integrated Weed Management Plan, CRMP SOP 18 (SOPs Common to All), MM VG-1, Western\nSolar Plan PDFs ER1-1 and ER2-1, and CRMP SOP 7 (Air, Soils, and Water) would be implemented.\nThese measures would reduce potentially adverse effects, but the Project could still result in a higher\ncover and density of invasive plant species within the solar site and in adjacent habitat over time.\nConstruction of the gen-tie, as a linear feature, could also result in the spread of additional weed species\nalong its length. These measures could reduce some adverse effects on native vegetation and special\nstatus species from the spread of invasive weeds. However, adverse direct and indirect impacts would still\noccur from increased disturbance in the area and expected introduction and proliferation of these invasive\nspecies.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\nO&M activities would involve less repetitive ground disturbance than construction and would not extend\noutside of areas initially disturbed for construction. Areas of temporary disturbance would be restored and\nallowed to recover to the extent possible. Monitoring for restoration progress and invasive species\nmanagement would occur during O&M, as outlined in the Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan and\nIntegrated Weed Management Plan. Native vegetation would not be expected to regrow during the O&M\nperiod in areas that were cleared by grading or disk and roll methods (approximately 65 percent of the\napplication area).\n\nO&M impacts are anticipated to result in continued reduction of perennial vegetation cover throughout\nthe site across the 3,420 acres of permanent disturbance. Herbicides would be used to control the\nestablishment and spread of invasive species, which could have indirect effects on adjacent vegetation\ncommunities. Vegetation removal and soil compaction across the site would also result in increased\nrunoff of surface water during precipitation events, which could result in erosion and some increased\nsediment transport downstream of the Project site. To manage stormwater flows during O&M and reduce\ndownstream sedimentation impacts, the Project would include detention basins to capture surface water\nrunoff and sediment. New roadways could create erosion during O&M. All roads used for O&M would\nbe inspected, and erosion would be repaired as part of the maintenance (MM WR-3) to avoid off-site\nimpacts to vegetation.\n\nSolar panels create shade that can alter soil temperature, soil moisture, and the amount of light available\nfor plants to photosynthesize (S. M. Grodsky and Hernandez 2020; Vervloesem et al. 2022; Tanner et al.\n2020). These altered microhabitat conditions may affect the abundance, survival, and reproduction of\nnative desert plants and could result in the loss of native plant communities for the duration of the Project\nand likely for decades to a century or more after decommissioning. This long-term loss of native\nvegetation can lead to increased weeds, dust emissions and erosion, loss of wildlife habitat and\nbiodiversity, and adverse visual effects.\n\n\n-----\n\nWestern Solar Plan PDF ER3-1 requires the Applicant to maintain native vegetation to the extent possible\nand control invasive species during O&M of the Project. Western Solar Plan PDFs SR3-1, SR3-2, and\nAQC2-1 would be implemented to control sources of fugitive dust generated during O&M, including use\nof water and/or soil palliatives approved by the BLM. Consultation with the BLM would be maintained\nthroughout O&M in accordance with Western Solar Plan PDFs ER3-1 and ER3-2, which require utilizing\nintegrated pest management and an adaptive management strategy, as necessary.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nDecommissioning is anticipated to only directly affect areas that were previously disturbed during Project\nconstruction and O&M. With the soil disturbance and compaction from Project construction, most of the\nnative seed bank in the soil would not be viable, so other sources of native seed would be needed for\nrestoration. This need could put added pressure on regional seed sources, resulting in an adverse impact\non adjacent communities where seeds are sourced. Vegetation communities could take as long as a\ncentury to fully recover to pre-disturbance conditions, if they do at all (S. R. Abella 2010). Over a long\nperiod of time, the cover of perennial plants would be reestablished. The Decommissioning and Site\nReclamation Plan would include a description of acceptable seed types, seeding techniques, a monitoring\nand reporting plan, and performance standards, per MM VG-1. Decommissioning would set the Project\nsite on a trajectory to regain some percentage of native perennial species cover; however, some species\nare not expected to ever recolonize the site given the level of disturbance, which would be an adverse\neffect.\n\nImpacts to special status plant species from decommissioning would not be expected because individuals\nof sensitive species would likely be permanently lost during the construction and O&M phases of the\nProject. Implementation of a Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan would reduce potential adverse\neffects to sensitive plant habitats. Should newly discovered sensitive plant species be identified prior to\ndecommissioning, MM VG-2 would also apply to these locations. Western Solar Plan PDFs SR4-1, SR42, and SR4-3 would also be applicable as they address reclamation, applying design features to avoid soil\nerosion, restoring original grades as much as possible, and restoring native plant communities.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nA number of projects and other management actions in the region could potentially contribute to\ncumulative impacts to vegetation, including other current and proposed utility-scale solar development\nprojects, transmission lines, and pit mining as proposed as part of the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine\nExpansion. Other proposed solar projects within the Western Solar Plan variance areas and transmission\nline projects would involve ground disturbance and vegetation clearing, resulting in the loss of native\nvegetation communities, cacti, and special status plant species. Similar to the Project, these cumulative\nprojects would also likely result in the proliferation of invasive species and fugitive dust. The cumulative\nprojects could result in increased fire frequency or intensity resulting from a combination of abundant\ninvasive plant fuels and higher likelihood of anthropogenic ignitions that could have potentially severe\necosystem effects, adversely affecting sensitive plant communities and wildlife (S. R. Abella 2010; J.C.\nChambers et al. 2013a; S. M. Grodsky and Hernandez 2020). Cumulative impacts on regional vegetation\nresources include the loss of native vegetation, increased spread of invasive species, disturbance of the\nsoil seed bank, and loss of both perennial and annual plant diversity. Slow recovery from disturbance\nmeans impacts to these vegetation communities accumulate over time.\n\nMost vegetation within the region that would be affected by other actions is on BLM-managed land.\nOther solar projects within the variance areas would need to adhere to Western Solar Plan PDFs to avoid\nor reduce impacts to vegetation resources. Implementation of Western Solar Plan PDFs for the protection\nof ecological resources, soils, air quality, and wildland fire as well as all relevant MMs and BLM-required\nplans developed for the construction, O&M, and decommissioning of the Project would reduce the\nProject\u2019s contribution to adverse effects on vegetation resources. Due to the amount of areas within the\nregion that could potentially be affected, however, the effects would remain cumulatively adverse.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.7.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance, Fenced Corridors, and Vegetation and_**\n**_Topography Maintenance_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\nAlternative 1 would result in fewer impacts to vegetation from construction of the Project compared to the\nProposed Action. This alternative would include site preparation and construction methods that avoid\nmajor washes and maintain more areas of native perennial vegetation than the Proposed Action, including\nlimited overland travel that keeps vegetation intact (40 percent of the solar arrays at approximately 1,220\nacres) or overland travel that crushes vegetation but leaves the root masses intact (another 40 percent of\nthe solar arrays at approximately1,220 acres). Traditional construction methods (i.e., disk and roll and\ngrading) would be allowed on up to approximately 20 percent of the solar array blocks (612 acres). This\nalternative would result in an increase in the acreage of native vegetation that would be maintained or\npotentially restorable within the solar arrays (2,450 acres), which would be a reduction in that same\namount of native vegetation lost from grading and disk and roll under the Proposed Action. At the end of\nconstruction, approximately 60 percent of the application area would have vegetation maintained versus\n36 percent under the Proposed Action. Within most construction areas for the solar panel arrays,\ntopography, soils, and vegetation would be left in place, and the installation of solar array components\nwould occur over these existing resources. Vegetation not subject to grading, crushing, or other\ndisturbance would be trimmed, but only if its height would interfere with the installation of the solar\npanels or safety. All other Project components would remain the same as the Proposed Action.\n\nWith the reduction in areas that would be permanently impacted through grading or disk and roll, as well\nas a maximum threshold set for native perennial vegetation loss, this alternative would result in fewer\nimpacts to native vegetation communities, special status plant species, and cacti within the Project solar\nsite as compared to the Proposed Action. In areas where soils remain intact, there would be a reduced\nlikelihood of invasive species infestations and loss of soil seed banks (J.C. Chambers et al. 2013a;\nCopeland and Butterfield 2017; S.M. Grodsky, Tanner, and Hernandez 2020; J.E. Lovich and Ennen\n2011a). Although disturbances to vegetation and soils across the Project site would be reduced,\nconstruction activities could still introduce new weed species to the Project area or spread seeds of\nexisting weeds. Western Solar Plan PDFs, Project MMs, and the Integrated Weed Management Plan as\ndescribed above for the Proposed Action would be implemented under this alternative and would likely\nbe more successful, with fewer infestations, due to the reduction in ground disturbance. With the\nimplementation of these combined measures and the reduced overall disturbance to vegetation from\nconstruction, this alternative would result in fewer impacts to native vegetation communities as compared\nwith the Proposed Action, but impacts would still occur and thus remain adverse.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\nUnder Alternative 1, vegetation would be maintained across the Project site during the O&M phase of the\nProject. O&M vehicle use within the solar site could result in ground disturbance and crushed vegetation\nbut would be limited to access roads and the shortest routes possible off roads. When possible, work\nactivities would be performed on foot. Vegetation would be trimmed as needed to prevent interference or\nsafety issues within the solar facilities, which may reduce plant vigor and survival and may remove\nflowers and seeds depending on when the plants are trimmed. Ground disturbance associated with\ntrimming may also result in additional crushing or other damage of vegetation. However, compared with\nthe Proposed Action, this alternative is expected to result in survival of perennial plants, including cacti.\nDeterminations for trimming would be made on an individual solar array basis so that there would be no\nmass trimming actions on large areas of vegetation. During O&M of the Project, drive and crush areas\nwould be actively restored. Approximately 40 percent (1,220 acres) of the areas under the panels would\nbe constructed using drive and crush methods. At least 20 percent of those areas are expected to be\nrestored to native vegetation types during the 30-year O&M phase, for a total of 245 acres. By the end of\nthe O&M phase, up to 65 percent of the application area is expected to have native vegetation cover (as\ncompared to 36 percent under the Proposed Action). The Integrated Weed Management Plan would be\nimplemented and would result in reduced impacts to vegetation during O&M. This alternative would also\nresult in reduced indirect impacts from temperature increases during O&M of the Project. Retaining\n\n\n-----\n\nvegetation within solar panel arrays would maintain the temperature of the site as compared to projects\nwhere vegetation is completely removed (Scott R. Abella 2010; Barron-Gafford et al. 2019; Devitt et al.\n2022; Williams et al. 2023).\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nDecommissioning and site restoration would be more successful than under the Proposed Action due to a\nreduced area of permanent disturbance, with vegetation recovering more easily and intensive restoration\nlikely needed only in graded areas. The long-term impacts to vegetation communities would be reduced.\nImplementation of the Decommissioning and Site Reclamations Plan would further reduce potential\nadverse effects on vegetation during decommissioning. Decommissioning under Alternative 1 would\ntherefore result in an overall reduced impact to native vegetation.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nLess impactful construction techniques and retention of vegetation during construction and O&M would\nresult in higher vegetation survival and plant diversity, which would reduce the contribution to\ncumulative losses and/or adverse effects to native vegetation within the region. Because the anticipated\nrecovery time post-Project is expected to be less for this alternative than for the Proposed Action (5 to 10\nyears for the majority of the Project site, as opposed to hundreds of years), cumulative impacts would be\nreduced. Retaining vegetation also improves vegetation community resiliency for adapting to climate\nchange impacts. Cumulative impacts to native vegetation communities would still be adverse due to\nground disturbance, crushing, trimming, dust emissions, and invasive species; however, these impacts\nwould be reduced under this alternative and would result in a reduced contribution to any cumulative\nimpacts to vegetation resources within the Mason Valley.\n\n**_3.7.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nConstruction, O&M, and decommissioning impacts from this alternative would be the same as described\nfor the Proposed Action for the solar site. Impacts could vary from the use of supplemental access roads.\nThese routes have already been disturbed and are not likely to contain suitable habitat for special status\nplants directly adjacent. No upgrades or new disturbance would be associated with the use of\nsupplemental access roads, so there would be no direct impacts to vegetation; however, there could be\nindirect impacts. Roads are common vectors for invasive species, and the use of additional access routes\ncould contribute to the proliferation of weeds. The increased use of unpaved segments of roads could also\ncontribute to an increase in impacts on nearby vegetation from fugitive dust. Because these roads are\ncurrently used and maintained, it is unlikely that these effects would be noticeable beyond existing\nconditions. The routes would only regularly be used as supplemental access during Project construction\nand would not be used during O&M, so there would be no impacts from O&M. Supplemental access\nroutes may be used during decommissioning as well, depending on timing, but resulting impacts are not\nexpected to exceed those from construction. This alternative would result in the same contribution to\ncumulative impacts as described for the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.7.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\n\n**Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Decommissioning Impacts**\nConstruction, O&M, and decommissioning impacts from this alternative would be the same as described\nfor the Proposed Action for the solar site and the access road. The gen-tie would be reduced from a\n24.1-mile-long line from the solar site to the Fort Churchill substation to a 0.54-mile-long gen-tie line\nextending from the eastern boundary of the solar site to a new switching station under the adjacent\nGreenlink West line. The new gen-tie and switching station would result in disturbance of just under 12\nacres, a reduction of 92 acres of permanent disturbance and 100 acres of temporary disturbance as\ncompared with the Proposed Action. Direct and indirect impacts to vegetation from construction, O&M,\nand decommissioning would thereby be reduced as compared with the Proposed Action.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nCumulative impacts to vegetation would be similar to those for the Proposed Action. The gen-tie length\nwould be reduced from 24.1 miles to 0.54 mile, which would reduce the Project\u2019s contribution to native\n\n\n-----\n\nvegetation disturbance and removal within the Mason Valley. The reduction in impacts would be limited,\nas the solar field would contribute the largest cumulative loss of vegetation within the analysis area.\n\n**_3.7.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the Project would not be constructed, and existing land uses would\ncontinue. The BLM would continue to manage the land consistent with the CRMP. There would be no\nimpacts to vegetation from large scale solar construction, and existing habitat conditions and trends would\nremain. The vegetation communities currently exhibit gradual encroachment from invasive species, which\nmay continue to exist or expand over time.\n\n**_3.7.4.7 Relevant Required Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP_**\n**_Standard Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nPDFs from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B.

If any weeds are discovered that are\nbeginning to go to seed before they have been treated, they shall be hand-pulled, bagged in a\npuncture-proof bag or container, and disposed of in an enclosed, off-site trash receptacle.\n\n\u2013 Reporting shall be conducted biannually during construction, restoration of temporary\ndisturbance areas, and the first 3 years of operation and maintenance. This monitoring shall\nbe compiled into an annual report that details all dates when monitoring occurred; the dates of\nall weed treatments; the number and types of weeds found; if any new weeds were located;\nand the amount, types, and locations of herbicides used (in accordance with the PUP).\nReporting shall be submitted to the BLM on or before December 31 of each year. During the\ninitial years when biannual reporting is required, reports shall also be submitted on or before\nJuly 1 (to document that spring surveys and treatments for weeds took place).\n\n\u2013 Weed vectors (e.g., roads, transmission lines) associated with the Project shall also be\nmonitored and treated according to the Integrated Weed Management Plan.\n\n\u2013 Only certified weed-free materials shall be used during construction, restoration, and O&M.\nThis includes gravel, seed mixes, and any waddles or other erosion control devices.\n\n\u2013 Prevention measures shall be implemented, including Worker Environmental Awareness\nProgram (WEAP) training and vehicle and equipment cleaning protocols (as described in the\nIntegrated Weed Management Plan) as well as construction reporting.\n\n-  Cacti\n\n\u2013 Where feasible, healthy, viable cacti within permanent disturbance areas where vegetation is\nremoved (e.g., roads, battery storage areas, traditional development areas, transmission line\ntowers) shall be salvaged and planted in an on-site nursery for use in restoration areas, per\nBLM\u2019s forestry program guidance. More details shall be included in the Site Restoration and\nRevegetation Plan .\n\n**MM VG-2: Special Status Plant Pre-Construction Surveys**\n\n-  Prior to construction, a botanical survey for special status plant species shall be performed to\nidentify and flag individuals or populations that are present within potential impact areas.\nThese species shall be avoided where possible, and where it is possible for the individual to\nsurvive after construction (e.g., along the edge of the solar facility or temporary construction\nareas along the gen-tie).\n\n-  Herbicide treatment shall be completed in special status plant habitat prior to March 15 to\navoid non-target impacts to sensitive plant species. After March 15, only hand-pulling of\nweeds in any sensitive milkvetch habitat is permitted.\n\n-  Where avoidance is not possible, seed collection of special status plants that would be\naffected shall occur in accordance with the Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan.\nCollections shall follow the Center for Plant Conservation (CPC) guidelines for seed\n\n\n-----\n\ncollection and include storage at a qualified CPC regional seedbank.

The Proposed Action\nwould result in the permanent loss of native vegetation on 3,420 acres within primarily Bailey\u2019s\ngreasewood shrublands. Site reclamation, even with substantial effort, is not expected to restore these\nimpacted areas to pre-Project conditions for decades to a century or more. Repeated restoration efforts\nwould be necessary. Many species, such as cacti and other perennial shrubs, would not be expected to\nrecolonize the site, and changes to native species composition would be considered permanent.\nApproximately 839 individual cacti could be permanently lost from Project construction. Most of these\nare the more common grizzlybear prickly pear, but some special status species of sand cholla (an\nestimated 22 individuals, with potentially more along the gen-tie) would be lost and are not likely to grow\nback in areas of disturbance. Permanent loss of native vegetation communities would remain with the\nconstruction techniques identified in the Proposed Action even with the identified mitigation measures.\nThese losses would be considered irretrievable. Alternative 1 would have similar effects but they would\nbe reduced, and native vegetation cover would be more retrievable. Alternatives 2 and 3 would have\nimpacts the same as or similar to the Proposed Action.\n\nResidual effects would include the direct and indirect impacts from the Project, including soil erosion,\nfugitive dust, and the spread of invasive weed species that would persist even with mitigation measures.\nThese impacts would be minimized with Western Solar Plan PDFs, management plans, and Projectspecific MMs, but would likely not be eliminated. Alternative 2 would reduce residual effects the most, as\ncompared with the Proposed Action and other alternatives.\n\n##### 3.8 General Wildlife; Special Status Wildlife Species; and Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, and Candidate Species\n\n**3.8.1 Introduction**\nThis section provides a summary of the general wildlife resources, including special status species that are\nknown to occur or could occur in the Project area and that could be affected by Project construction,\nO&M, and decommissioning. General wildlife includes all wildlife species that are not federally, or State\nlisted or BLM sensitive species. Special status species include those that are BLM sensitive species, avian\nspecies protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) or Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act\n(BGEPA), USFWS birds of conservation concern (BCC), species protected in Nevada under NAC\nChapter 503, and NDOW species of greatest conservation need (SGCN). Threatened, endangered,\nproposed, and candidate species are those identified as such under the ESA. The Project is not within BiState sage grouse habitat areas identified in the 2016 Bi-State Sage Grouse Plan Amendment.\n\nThe BLM manages wildlife and their habitats according to the CRMP, BLM Manual 6500 Fish and\nWildlife Conservation, and the BLM Manual 6720 Aquatic Resource Management. The BLM provides\npolicy and guidance for the conservation of BLM special status species and habitat on BLM-administered\nlands, including through BLM Manual 6840. Wildlife conservation by the State of Nevada is regulated\nunder NRS Title 45 and is further guided by the Nevada Wildlife Action Plan (Barnes, J. et al. 2023).\n\nThe following survey reports were used to determine the likelihood that special status species are present\nwithin the Project area and could be affected by construction, O&M, and decommissioning of the Project.\n\n-  Botanical Resources Report: Libra Solar Project (Phoenix 2023b)\n\n\n-----\n\n-  Golden Eagle ( _Aquila chrysaetos_ ) Survey Report, Libra Solar Project (Dugan and Phoenix 2022)\n\n-  Memorandum \u2013 Preliminary Results for Libra Solar Avian & Raptor Surveys (Phoenix 2023)\n\n-  Bat Acoustic Activity Surveys for the Libra Solar Project, Final Report (Western Ecosystems\n2023)\n\n-  Pale and Dark Kangaroo Mouse Survey Report, Libra Solar Project (Phoenix 2022a)\n\n**3.8.2 Analysis Area**\nThe analysis area for consideration of impacts related to habitat connectivity and migration for wildlife\nand special status species is the Project site (including the solar site, gen-tie corridor, and access roads),\nadjacent mountain ranges, and the Mason Valley. This area is intended to capture existing conditions and\npotential impacts to individuals, habitats, and movement corridors for wide-ranging species such as bats,\nbirds, and larger mammals that may have the potential to occur. For wildlife with smaller home ranges\n(e.g., reptiles, small mammals), most of the effects would be limited to the Project area and immediate\nvicinity. In accordance with USFWS guidance for protection of nesting eagles, the analysis area for\ngolden eagle ( _Aquila chrysaetos_ ) extends up to 10 miles from the Project site.\n\nFor cumulative effects, the analysis area includes the Mason Valley and Wassuk Range, within which\nsimilar special status species populations or habitats might occur and might be affected by other projects\nor management actions therein. Cumulative projects or actions within the region would affect habitat\nnecessary to conserve the genetic, behavioral, morphological, and ecological diversity conducive to longterm sustainability of species.\n\n**3.8.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.8.3.1 General Wildlife_**\nWildlife species include mammals, reptiles, and birds. The solar site has been utilized for cattle grazing in\nthe past, as evidenced by fencing, improvements for watering livestock, a few skeletal remains, and cow\nmanure. The land is presently utilized occasionally by a herd or herds of wild horses; however, it is not in\na BLM-designated herd management area. The closest management area is the Wassuk Herd\nManagement Area, southeast of the solar site. No wild horses were encountered during field visits, but\nthere was ample fresh evidence of their presence. Many terrestrial invertebrate species have potential to\noccur within the Project site. Invertebrates are a vital food source for other wildlife as well as important\npollinators for native vegetation and are often critical to healthy and functioning ecosystems . General\ntypes of terrestrial invertebrates found in desert habitats of the Great Basin include moths, butterflies,\nbees, ants, beetles, spiders, scorpions, grasshoppers, and crickets.\n\nThe Project solar site was surveyed for special status species including small mammals, burrowing owls,\navian species, and bats. Reconnaissance surveys were performed December 14, 2021, and January 19,\n2022, to identify general habitats for wildlife species (Phoenix 2022b).\n\n**_3.8.3.2 Big Game Species_**\nBig game species found in the region include desert bighorn sheep ( _Ovis canadensis nelsoni_ ) and\npronghorn antelope ( _Antilocapra americana_ ). Both species are priority species managed as game animals\nby NDOW. The range for desert bighorn sheep does not extend into the Project area; however, bighorn\nsheep may be found higher in the Wassuk Range east of and adjacent to the solar site, just north of the\ngen-tie alignment in the Desert Mountains, and in the Singatse Range to the west, beyond Yerington (>10\nmiles away from the solar site, as shown in Figure 3.8-1). Current mapping for pronghorn antelope shows\ntheir distribution ranges are even further to the east and west from the solar site, beyond the Wassuk\nRange and the Singatse Range (shown in Figure 3.8-1). However, pronghorn antelope are known to\nmoderately utilize habitats within the Project area for foraging and migration and have been observed\nduring various field visits. Winter fat occurs in this landscape and is a critical forage component for big\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.8-1 Desert Bighorn Sheep and Pronghorn Antelope Ranges within the Vicinity of the**\n**Proposed Project**\n\nSource: (NDOW 2010)\n\n\n-----\n\ngame species. While pronghorn antelope occur in the study area, the study area is not within a significant\nmigration corridor for these species.\n\n**_3.8.3.3 Small Mammals_**\nA small-mammal trapping study was performed for the study area to determine whether two BLM\nsensitive species, dark kangaroo mouse ( _Microdipodops megacephalus_ ) and pale kangaroo mouse\n( _Microdipodops_ _pallidus_ ), were present, as an initial study indicated a potential to occur. Neither was\ncaptured during the trapping sessions (Phoenix 2022a). However, one NDOW Species of Conservation\nPriority (Wildlife Action Plan Team 2012), desert kangaroo rat ( _Dipodomys deserti_ ), was captured. This\nspecies is found in a wide range of arid habitats in the Great Basin, usually low deserts with sandy soil\nand sparse vegetation.\n\n**_3.8.3.4 Bats_**\nBat activity was monitored at two stations within the study area, within desert scrub representative of the\nsolar site as a whole, from March to October of 2022. Of the 19 bat species that have the potential to\noccur within the study area, 18 were detected (Western Ecosystems 2023), with the exception being the\nspotted bat ( _Euderma maculatum_ ). Spotted bats range widely in Nevada but are uncommon. All bats are\nprotected in Nevada (NAC Chapter 503) and are identified as NDOW Species of Conservation Priority\n(Barnes, J. et al. 2023). All bats detected are also BLM sensitive species. Overall, bat activity at the\nsurvey stations was lowest in the spring and highest in the fall, during the migration period (Western\nEcosystems 2023). Results from the two detectors for overall activity were similar, suggesting\nhomogeneity in the quality of bat habitat throughout the study area. Detectors were not sited near focused\nattractants for roosting or foraging (e.g., water bodies, abandoned mines, seeps and springs, cattle tanks,\nguzzlers) because none of these features are present within the solar site; results therefore can be assumed\nto reflect bat presence throughout the study area. However, the gen-tie crosses permanent water sources\nthat could attract more bat activity. The study area consists of marginal habitat for either roosting or\nforaging for all bat species detected. While ephemeral drainages could be suitable for foraging during the\nrainy season, better roosting and foraging habitat occurs around Walker Lake, approximately 11 miles to\nthe southeast of the Project solar site. More suitable roosting habitat occurs at abandoned mines as close\nas 2.5 miles southeast of the solar site.\n\n**_3.8.3.5 Birds_**\n\n**Golden Eagle**\nMountainous areas within the Wassuk Range (the north, northeast, east, and southeast portions of the\nstudy area) contain the greatest density of high-quality golden eagle nesting habitat. The western and\ncentral portions of the study area, which include the solar site and most of the area within 3 miles, are\ncharacterized by flat topography, low-lying alluvial features, and riverbed habitats. Lacking vertical cliffs\nand rocky features, these areas contain only substandard golden eagle nesting habitat that is largely\nlimited to low-lying structures within isolated foothills. However, the Project site contains foraging\nhabitat commonly used by golden eagles.\n\nUSFWS-protocol surveys for golden eagle were performed for the study area and 10-mile buffer during\nwinter, spring, and summer of 2022 (Dugan and Phoenix 2022). Six golden eagle nests, none of which\nwere occupied or contained eggs or chicks at the time of surveys, were observed across three nesting\nlocations. All nests were in rocky cliff habitats in locations that offered shelter from most potential\nanthropogenic disturbances, showed no signs of use or maintenance during the 2022 nesting season, and\nlacked a developed nest bowl. Moderate levels of anthropomorphic disturbance were noted, including but\nnot limited to paved roads, OHV travel, fence lines, farming, and mining operations. Six live golden\neagles were observed, including adult pairs perched near an unoccupied nest. The survey area\napproximately overlaps the southern half of the gen-tie alignment, which, in its northern half, runs\nadjacent to the proposed Greenlink West transmission line. The entire Greenlink West alignment, plus a\n2-mile buffer, was surveyed in December 2021 and January 2022, with a second round of surveys in\nMarch and April of 2022. No nests were found in proximity to the northern half of the proposed Project\u2019s\ngen-tie alignment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Migratory Birds**\nMigratory birds are protected under the MBTA and NAC Section 503.050. Avian species were identified\nduring avian point-count surveys during spring, summer, and fall of 2022 (Phoenix 2023). Overall,\nspecies diversity and abundance are low within the study area. The years prior to surveys experienced\nbelow-average rainfall, likely resulting in decreased productivity in avian species. Across the three\nseasons of surveys, 11 different species were noted: American kestrel ( _Falco sparverius_ ), barn swallow\n( _Hirundo rustica_ ), Brewer\u2019s sparrow ( _Spizella breweri_ ), common raven ( _Corvus corax_ ), house finch\n( _Haemorhous mexicanus_ ), horned lark ( _Eremophila alpestris_ ), loggerhead shrike ( _Lanius ludovicianus_ ),\nmourning dove ( _Zenaida macroura_ ), red-tailed hawk ( _Buteo jamaicensis_ ), sagebrush sparrow\n( _Artemisiospiza nevadensis_ ), sage thrasher ( _Oreoscoptes montanus_ ), and western meadowlark ( _Sturnella_\n_neglecta_ ). Call broadcast surveys for burrowing owls ( _Athene_ _cunicularia_ ) were also conducted during\nspring of 2022 at 20 different sites throughout the solar site. No burrowing owl vocalizations were\nrecorded during any of the site visits, indicating burrowing owls were not on site; however, the revised\ngen-tie alignment has not been surveyed, and burrowing owls may be present along with other MBTAprotected species.\n\nIn addition to the avian point-count surveys, raptor surveys were conducted in October 2022 (Phoenix\n2023). Incidental observations of raptors were also recorded during the golden eagle protocol surveys\n(Dugan and Phoenix 2022) _._ Additional species observations include Cooper\u2019s hawk ( _Accipiter cooperii_ ),\nferruginous hawk ( _Buteo_ _regalis_ ), northern harrier ( _Circus hudsonius_ ), osprey ( _Pandion haliaetus_ ), prairie\nfalcon ( _Falcomexicanus_ ), sharp-shinned hawk ( _Accipiter striatus_ ), and turkey vulture ( _Cathartes aura_ ).\nRaptor nests were also observed during golden eagle surveys, including six red-tailed hawk nests, four\ncommon raven nests, and one unidentified falcon nest. All were unoccupied except one red-tailed hawk\nnest. The occupied red-tailed hawk nest was observed in a large tree; all other nests were located on rocky\nsubstrates including vertical cliff faces, rocky buttes, rock cavities, and ledges.\n\n**Bi-State Sage-grouse**\nThe Bi-State greater sage-grouse is a genetically unique population, known as a _distinct population_\n_segment_ (DPS), of greater sage-grouse that lives in the far southwestern limit of the species\u2019 range in the\nCalifornia/Nevada Bi-State area. The Bi-State DPS is characterized as a genetically diverse, locally\nadapted meta-population consisting of several relatively small, localized breeding populations distributed\namong suitable sagebrush habitats throughout the Bi-State area (Bi-State Technical Advisory Committee\nNevada and California 2012). In April 2023, the USFWS initiated a new status review to determine\nwhether the Bi-State DPS meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the ESA (88\nFR 25613). The status of this species is still currently under review.\n\nThere are six _population management units_ (PMUs) designated for the Bi-State DPS. The solar site is\npartially located in the Mount Grant PMU. In the lower elevations of the Mount Grant PMU, the\navailability of quality nesting and brood rearing habitat are limiting factors. Habitat quality and\nproductivity is better in the upper elevations of the PMU but is limited in overall extent (see Figure\n3.8-2). The solar site does not contain species of sagebrush that support Bi-State sage grouse and is\nlocated in an area of unsuitable habitat and, therefore, this species is not expected to be present. The\nnearest mapped Bi-State sage grouse habitat is within 0.25 mile of the gen-tie at its closest point;\nhowever, the gen-tie at its closest proximity to the habitat is in a valley over 300 feet lower in elevation\nthan the habitat. The area of mapped habitat, additionally, is of low-value or is transitional habitat and no\nleks are known to occur in this area (Figure 3.8-2).\n\n**Western Yellow-billed Cuckoo**\nThe western yellow-billed cuckoo ( _Coccyzus americanus_ ) is a migratory bird species, traveling between\nits breeding grounds in North America (Continental U.S. and Mexico) and its wintering grounds in\nCentral and South America each spring and fall, often using river corridors as travel routes (USFWS\n2014; Johnson et al. 2008).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.8-2 Bi-State Greater Sage Grouse Population Management Units and Habitat Suitability**\n\nSource: (BLM 2016; NDOW 2015; 2017)\n\n\n-----\n\nOn October 3, 2014, the USFWS published a final rule (79 FR 59991) listing the western Distinct\nPopulation Segment (DPS) of the western yellow-billed cuckoo as threatened under the ESA. Western\nDPS yellow-billed cuckoos have historically bred in riparian areas across most of North America, from\nsoutheastern and western Canada throughout the continental United States to northern Mexico (Johnson,\net al., 2007). Although population trend data is lacking, rough extrapolations of historic and current\ninformation suggest that the western yellow-billed cuckoo\u2019s habitat distribution, range, and population\nnumbers have declined across much of the western United States over the past 50 years (USFWS, 2014).\nIt is now only known to breed in isolated locations in Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada,\nCalifornia, and Sonora and Chihuahua in northern Mexico (Johnson et al. 2008; USFWS 2021).\n\nWestern yellow-billed cuckoos require structurally complex riparian vegetation with tall trees and a dense\nwoody understory. They breed in large blocks of riparian vegetation, particularly in woodlands with\ncottonwoods and willows, usually not far from sources of water such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and\nwetlands. Habitat requirements for wintering are not well known but include brushy savanna edges,\nshrubby clearings and pastures, and woodlands near water. Critical habitat was designated in 2021 but\ndoes not include Nevada (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 2021). Three western yellow-billed\ncuckoo have been documented within the vicinity of the gen-tie. The nearest observation was in Mason\nValley WMA in 2016 (Enders, Mark 2023). A pair of cuckoos was also observed further down the\nWalker River near the town of Schurz in 2013, which is on the other side of the Wassuk Range from the\ngen-tie. These observations indicate that the western yellow-billed cuckoo may utilize the Walker River\ncorridor and have the potential to be present within the vicinity of the gen-tie where it crosses the river.\nHowever, the habitat within the gen-tie analysis area is of marginal quality for western yellow-billed\ncuckoo, and this species is unlikely to be present at this location.\n\n**_3.8.3.6 Monarch Butterfly_**\nThe monarch butterfly ( _Danaus plexippus plexippus_ ) is a federal candidate species for listing under the\nESA and is a BLM sensitive species as well as a NDOW SGCN. After an extensive status assessment of\nthe monarch butterfly in 2020, the USFWS determined that listing the monarch under the ESA is\nwarranted but precluded at that time by higher priority listing actions. The monarch butterfly remains a\ncandidate for listing and the USFWS reviews its status each year until they are able to begin developing a\nproposal to list the monarch.\n\nArid environments do not usually have vegetation communities with large numbers of nectar-producing\nplants, and this species would not be expected to occur in abundance within the Project site. However,\nlarvae host plant species (narrowleaf milkweed [ _Asclepias fascicularis_ ]) were observed within the gen-tie\nanalysis area during surveys. No species of milkweed were observed during surveys of the solar site or\naccess road analysis areas (Phoenix 2023b). There have been sightings of monarchs within the Mason\nValley WMA where there is more milkweed present; however, these observations are from the 1980\u2019s.\nThe most recent sightings from 2016 (including breeding monarchs) and 2020 have been around\nagricultural fields north and south of Yerington, well outside the vicinity of the Project.\n\n**3.8.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.8.4.1 Methods_**\nDirect effects to wildlife, including special status species, could occur from noise disturbance,\nharassment, entrapment, injury, and mortality, as well as changes in habitat use or behavior such as\nmovement, foraging, or breeding. Indirect effects include changes in the characteristics or quality of\nhabitat (e.g., loss, degradation, modification).\n\nThe Project would result in short-term, long-term, and permanent effects to wildlife. Short-term effects\nwould be associated with Project construction and are not expected to persist beyond 5 years following\nthe construction phase and restoration of temporary use areas. Long-term effects are expected during\nO&M for the 30-year duration of the Project. Permanent effects are expected in areas of complete\nremoval of native vegetation (refer to _Section 3.7 Vegetation, Special Status Plants, and Noxious Weeds_ ).\nThe term \u201cpermanent\u201d accounts for the fact that plant communities in desert ecosystems could take a\n\n\n-----\n\ncentury or longer to fully recover or may not at all. Long-term effects to wildlife beyond 30 years are\ndifficult to predict due to the increasingly unknowable nature of species interactions and environmental\nvariables over time.\n\n**_3.8.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**General Wildlife.** Project construction would result in adverse impacts to native vegetation that provides\nhabitat for wildlife. The Project would result in 3,420 acres of permanent ground disturbance for the solar\nsite, access roads, and gen-tie. The CRMP SOP 6 (Common to All) requires vegetation disturbance to be\nlimited to the minimum amount needed. The permanent loss of habitat for wildlife during construction\nwould be locally, but not regionally, adverse due to the extensive amount of similar habitat in the Central\nBasin and Range Province, which covers approximately 42,486 square miles (27,191,040 acres), with\n8,752 square miles (5,601,280 acres) in northern Nevada. Most wildlife would not be expected to remain\non site during construction due to large areas of ground-disturbance, human presence, and vegetation\nremoval.\n\nDirect effects, such as injury or mortality of wildlife, may occur from contact with Project facilities and\nequipment during construction. Many animals are susceptible to visual, noise, and vibration disturbances\ncaused by the presence of humans and construction equipment. Such disturbances could cause wildlife to\nalter foraging and breeding behavior and avoid suitable habitat; however, construction activities would be\ntemporary. Construction disturbances could decrease individual animal fitness and lower the chances of\nsurvival or reproduction, potentially resulting in population-level adverse impacts that are harder to\nquantify without long-term demographic studies (Chock et al. 2021). Any disturbances to foraging or\nbreeding, or direct harm to wildlife would be adverse. Mitigation measures to minimize disturbance or\nharm to wildlife include MM WILD-1, which requires the presence of an approved biologist and monitors\non site during construction to ensure protection of wildlife; MM WILD-2, which requires the WEAP to\ninclude discussion of wildlife avoidance; and MMs WILD-3 and WILD-4, which would prevent injuries\nto wildlife in equipment or from vehicle collisions and require escape ramps and other escape methods in\nexcavations and water storage ponds. Implementation of these mitigation measures would reduce the\npotential for adverse effects; however, disturbances and direct harm from Project construction would not\nbe completely avoidable. Impacts would be short-term for the duration of construction and would not be\nexpected to result in a notable loss of local wildlife.\n\nExposure to herbicides or other hazardous materials, such as oil or other petroleum products, could also\ndirectly affect wildlife species. Contact or ingestion of chemicals can not only kill wildlife but are also\nknown to disrupt hormones in animals, potentially affecting behavior and the ability to reproduce. Direct\nharm or disruption of reproduction from hazardous materials could result in adverse impacts to wildlife.\nIn accordance with the BLM regulations, only herbicides with low toxicity to wildlife would be used and\nwould be applied in a manner consistent with their label requirements and agency guidance. Herbicides\nwould only be stored, handled, and used in accordance with an approved Integrated Weed Management\nPlan and PUP that are required per a BLM ROW grant and in accordance with the BLM manuals and\nguidance provided in the Final PEIS for Vegetation Treatments Using Herbicides on BLM Lands in 17\nWestern States (BLM 2007). Implementation of the BLM-required plans such as the SPCCP, Hazardous\nMaterials and Waste Management Plan, and WEAP training would ensure proper use, storage, and spill\nprevention for hazardous materials. Adherence to the protocols for proper use, containment, and disposal\nof hazardous materials outlined in these plans would reduce the likelihood of exposure to wildlife and\nadverse impacts.\n\nConstruction would have the potential to indirectly impact wildlife in surrounding areas. Habitat loss and\ndegradation from the introduction and spread of invasive species would reduce forage, shelter, nesting,\nand migration opportunities. This loss would cause species to rely more heavily on habitat in surrounding\nareas, which could increase competition for limited resources in those areas and could create barriers to\ngene flow. Loss of nesting habitat or burrows would cause wildlife to search for or dig new burrows or\nbuild new nests, subjecting them to stress and causing interruption to normal breeding periods, potentially\n\n\n-----\n\nresulting in a loss of reproduction (Grodsky et. al 2017). Construction would alter disturbance regimes\nwithin the solar site, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species, which in turn may alter species\ninteractions (Lovich and Ennen 2011; Tanner et al. 2020). Increased invasive species cover can create\nhighly flammable fine fuels across the landscape that increase the risk of wildfires and resulting habitat\nloss. Indirect effects from invasive species would be reduced through a BLM-required Integrated Weed\nManagement Plan developed to control invasive species within the Project area and minimize spread into\nadjacent habitats. MM WILD-1 and invasive species management would reduce effects; however,\nunavoidable habitat loss and degradation would occur, and therefore effects would remain adverse.\n\nOther MMs and applicable Western Solar Plan PDFs would be implemented to further minimize the\ndirect and indirect effects to wildlife from construction. In accordance with Western Solar Plan PDF ER\n2-1, a Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan would be developed to reduce the amount of habitat loss\nand accelerate recovery of natural habitats. Western Solar Plan PDF ER1-1 requires designation of a\nqualified biologist responsible for overseeing compliance with all PDFs related to the protection of\necological resources throughout all Project phases, particularly in areas requiring avoidance or containing\nsensitive biological resources. PDF ER1-1 also requires measures to ensure mitigation and monitoring of\nimpacts on special status wildlife in coordination with appropriate federal and state agencies. The\nimplementation of PDFs and MMs, as described above, would reduce the potential for adverse effects.\nHowever, construction would result in unavoidable habitat loss and disturbance to wildlife, and therefore\nadverse impacts would remain. Due to the amount of available habitat outside of the Project site, it is not\nexpected that local wildlife populations would be meaningfully affected.\n\n**Big Game Species.** The Project site is not within known ranges for bighorn sheep, and they are known to\nremain in higher elevations in the Wassuk Range. Pronghorn antelope are known to use habitats within\nthe Project area for foraging, as the vegetation communities contain winter fat ( _Krascheninnikovia_\n_lanata_ ), which is an important food source for these animals. Permanent security fencing installed around\nthe Project site would interfere with the movement and habitat use by animals too large to fit through or\nunder the fence, which includes pronghorn antelope. Pronghorn could still move around the site in similar\nhabitats if they are travelling through the area. Concerns were raised over whether the gen-tie would\nimpact migration of big game near the Mason Valley WMA. During construction, human presence could\ninhibit big game species from moving within the immediate area of work but not the entirety of the gentie development area, and individuals could move through areas not under construction. The Project\nwould not impede access to important riparian areas or water sources, as the gen-tie over the Walker\nRiver would allow movement and the nearest springs are several miles from the Project solar site. The\nsolar site is not a barrier to any water sources. Adverse impacts are not expected for bighorn sheep;\nhowever, adverse impacts could occur from loss of foraging habitat and movement barriers for pronghorn\nantelope. Impacts are not expected to conflict with the CRMP objectives for habitat management (BLM\n2001, WLD-1\u2013WLD-2); however, MM WILD-8 would be implemented to off-set the loss of foraging and\nsome migration habitat for pronghorn antelope through compensatory mitigation that includes restoring\nnatural springs used by pronghorn to the south of the Project site. The compensatory mitigation would be\ndeveloped in coordination with NDOW.\n\n**Small Mammals.** Desert kangaroo rats nest in burrows and are particularly susceptible to impacts from\nground-disturbing activities, such as disk and roll and grading. Ground disturbance associated with\nconstruction of the Project could destroy burrows and directly harm or kill individuals, whose presence\noften goes undetected as they are nocturnal. The Project would result in reduced foraging opportunities\nfor small mammals from vegetation removal associated with site preparation methods. In accordance with\nWestern Solar Plan PDF ER 2-1, a Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan would be developed to reduce\nthe amount of habitat loss and accelerate recovery of natural habitats, which would include the use of\nBLM-approved seed mixes that would contain grass species known to provide forage. Given the sparse\ndetections of small mammals during trapping surveys, they are likely not present in large numbers within\nthe Project site, and adverse impacts to species and population viability are not expected.\n\n**Bats.** No roosting habitat for bats occurs on the solar site or along the access road because there are no\ncaves, mines, cliffs, bridges, structures, or trees near a perennial water source to provide opportunities for\n\n\n-----\n\nroosting. Potentially suitable foraging habitat for bat species is present on the solar site, but the habitat is\nof marginal quality due to the lack of any permanent water source. The gen-tie alignment crosses\npermanent water sources, and bats could occur in larger numbers in those areas. There is limited\ninformation on the effects of utility-scale solar development on bats; however, the Project would result in\nhabitat loss and fragmentation, and it has recently been documented that overall bat activity is reduced at\nsolar sites compared to previous levels prior to construction (Tinsley et al. 2023). Bats are nocturnal\nspecies and could also be adversely affected by artificial lighting associated with construction. Night\nlighting installed for safety purposes may create light pollution and disorient bats. Construction activities\nwould primarily occur during daylight hours, some security lighting would be required at night during\nthose periods. Large areas of similar foraging habitat are available adjacent the solar site, and\nconstruction-related lighting would be temporary. The Bird and Bat Conservation Strategy (BBCS)\nincludes measures to detect and avoid or protect bats during construction to minimize effects in\naccordance with MM WILD-5. Adverse effects would be minimized.\n\n**Birds.** _Golden Eagles._ Potential direct impacts on nesting golden eagles as a result of Project-related\nconstruction activities include increased anthropogenic disturbances, injury, or mortality due to collisions\nwith Project equipment or vehicles, and abandonment of a breeding territory or nest sites. However, due\nto the distances from the Project site of all three golden eagle nesting locations and the steep topography\naround each nest, direct adverse impacts to nesting golden eagles would not occur. All six nests\ndocumented during the survey were located high on cliff features, 5 miles or more from the Project solar\nsite. This location offers them shelter from anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., human presence and noise)\nassociated with construction.\n\nThe solar site is characterized by flat topography and low-lying alluvial features and does not contain any\nsuitable nesting habitat for golden eagles; however, golden eagles could forage within the Project site\ngiven the proximity to potential nesting sites. Potential direct and indirect impacts to foraging golden\neagles include the loss of foraging habitat during construction and reduced prey species populations\nwithin foraging areas. Foraging behavior could also be affected by increased anthropogenic disturbances.\nEagles are a wide-ranging species and use a variety of habitats for foraging, and large areas of\nundisturbed habitat in the greater area and nearby Wassuk Mountain range would be available. Foraging\nhabitat within the Project solar site would be adversely affected. The gen-tie is proposed largely within an\nexisting designated transmission corridor adjacent to other existing and proposed transmission lines and\nnot within the steeper mountain ranges where golden eagle nests were found. As a linear facility, the gentie's construction would be localized at any one time and would not impact foraging or nesting golden\neagles.\n\n_Migratory Birds_ . Construction of the Project could affect migratory birds by removing or altering 3,420\nacres of potential migratory bird habitat from construction of the Proposed solar facility, gen-tie, and\nmodifications to an existing access road. Active bird nests in shrubs and those near or on the ground could\nbe directly affected during construction activities that cause ground disturbance and vegetation removal or\ncrushing, which could result in nest abandonment, nest destruction, and loss of chicks or eggs. Grading,\nleveling, and disk and roll construction methods would reduce available cover, foraging areas, and nesting\nand perching structures and would likely result in displacement of bird populations and adverse effects.\nConstruction activities also have the potential to cause visual and auditory disturbance, which could result\nin avoidance of otherwise suitable habitats. This disturbance could indirectly affect migratory birds by\ncausing stress and increased energetic costs as birds may end up nesting and foraging in less suitable\nhabitat. Direct and indirect impacts to avian species would be minimized with implementation of\nconservation measures to protect migrating and nesting birds through MM WILD-6, as well as CRMP\nSOP 9 (Common to All), and the BBCS. Measures include conducting ground-disturbing activities\noutside the migratory bird breeding season when practical or avoiding active nests if the work cannot be\nconducted outside this period (February/March through August) and conducting pre-construction surveys\nprior to vegetation clearing during the breeding season for nesting birds. If any occupied nests (those\ncontaining eggs or young) are found, an appropriate buffer around the nest site must be avoided until the\nyoung birds fledge. The buffers are based on specific requirements for each species or group, defined in\nthe BBCS. Spatial buffers would be applied depending on the biological needs of the species and\n\n\n-----\n\nsusceptibility to anthropogenic disturbances and could vary with changes in site conditions. Projectrelated impacts on migratory and other special status bird species are not expected to result in a large\nreduction in population levels; however, displacement of species from the Project area may put pressure\non adjacent habitats. Measures to protect migratory birds would reduce effects, but habitat loss and\ndisturbance to birds would still occur and impacts would remain adverse. Due to the amount of available\nhabitat outside of the Project site, it is not expected that local bird populations would be substantially\naffected.\n\nBurrowing owls are unlikely to be present within the solar site and were not identified during Project call\nbroadcast surveys specifically conducted to detect burrowing owls. Burrowing owls could occur in areas\nalong the gen-tie. If burrowing owls occur along the gen-tie, preparation and construction methods could\nresult in injury or mortality to adult owls, nestlings, or eggs that may occupy a previously undetected\nburrow. MM WILD-6 requires that burrowing owl surveys be conducted in areas of suspected owl\npresence (e.g., along the gen-tie) prior to construction following the USFWS protocol and that any nests\nbe avoided by at least 250 feet until the young have fledged. Protection measures for burrowing owls\nwould be included in the BLM-required BBCS and would minimize adverse impacts.\n\n_Bi-State Sage Grouse._ No direct or indirect impacts would occur to Bi-State sage grouse or their habitat.\nNeither the solar site, nor the gen-tie are within suitable habitat for Bi-State sage grouse. Patches of\nidentified low-quality/transitional habitat are located within 1 mile; however, no leks are known to occur\nin these areas, and the areas are at higher elevation than the solar site and gen-tie. At the closest point, the\ngen-tie is 0.25 miles from identified habitat; however, is at 300 feet lower elevation. Indirect impacts,\nsuch as visual disturbance from tall structures would not occur, since no leks have been found in this area.\nNo indirect impacts to the habitat would occur since the disturbance for the gen-tie is limited to areas of\nconstruction. Dust would be limited from gen-tie construction and would not drift upslope. No direct or\nindirect impacts would occur to habitat or Bi-State sage grouse individuals.\n\n_Yellow-billed Cuckoo._ No suitable habitat for the yellow-billed cuckoo is found within the solar site nor\nareas proposed for disturbance from construction of the gen-tie. Although never observed directly in the\narea of the gen-tie construction, if individuals were to be migrating along the Walker River, they could be\ndisturbed by construction activities. Impacts to western yellow-billed cuckoo would be avoided with\nimplementation of MM WILD-1 and MM WILD-6, which requires pre-construction surveys, biological\nmonitoring, and implementation of a limited operating period if the species is found within 0.5 mile of\nwork areas along the Walker River. With implementation of these measures, no impacts to western\nyellow-billed cuckoo would occur.\n\n**Pollinators and Monarch Butterfly.** Desert communities found within the Proposed Project area support\na highly diverse range of insect pollinators and plants with which pollinators have coevolved. Recent\nstudies have shown that solar energy development negatively affects pollinators, including butterflies,\nbees, flies, and beetles (Steven M. Grodsky, Campbell, and Hernandez 2021). Disruption of pollinator\npopulations may lead to cascading effects on biodiversity, including potential decreases in globally\nimperiled and highly valuable cacti populations dependent on insect pollination (Steven M. Grodsky,\nCampbell, and Hernandez 2021; Wagner et al. 2021). MM WILD-7 would require pre-construction\nsurveys to include identification and avoidance of bee overwintering sites, which would reduce impacts to\nthese resources. MM VEG-1 and the BLM-required Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan would\ninclude measures to restore temporary disturbance areas as quickly as possible once their use is no longer\nneeded for construction, which would facilitate revegetation with some flowering plants for pollinators.\nHowever, large areas of flowering perennial vegetation, such as cacti and yucca, would be lost due to\nconstruction, and impacts to these species would be adverse.\n\nMonarch butterfly are not expected to be present due to limited habitat for foraging within the majority of\nthe Project site and lack of recent detections nearby, as well as the limited observations of milkweed\nspecies within the analysis area (only found within the gen-tie study area, near the Walker River).\nAdverse direct and indirect impacts to monarch could occur if undetected milkweed plants are removed or\ncrushed during construction, since monarch may be found near milkweed, and it serves as a larval host\nplant. MM WILD-7 would require pre-construction surveys to include identification of milkweed plants\n\n\n-----\n\nand flagging for avoidance where possible. With the implementation of this measure, and the low\nlikelihood of monarchs being present at the time of construction, adverse impacts to this species would\nnot occur.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\n**General Wildlife.** O&M would result in long-term and permanent disturbance of habitat within the\nProject site. Impacts would include the loss of habitat and fragmentation, movement barriers, degradation\nof adjacent wildlife habitat, direct mortality, increased noise, dust and dust-suppression effects, light\npollution effects, and increased fire risk as a result of introduction and spread of invasive weed species\n(Scott R. Abella, Gentilcore, and Chiquoine 2021; Jeanne C. Chambers et al. 2013; S.M. Grodsky,\nTanner, and Hernandez 2020). The magnitude of ongoing disturbances to wildlife associated with O&M\nwould be less than that during construction, since active equipment, human presence, and noise would be\nreduced. Other direct effects to wildlife could occur from permanent security fencing installed around the\nProject site, which would interfere with the movement and habitat use by animals too large to fit through\nor under the fence. Similar habitat occurs adjacent to the Project site, and affected individuals too large to\npass through the fence would likely shift use to these adjacent areas. Smaller wildlife that can fit through\nor under the Project fences, such as rodents, reptiles, small mammals, and invertebrates, may still occupy\nthe site; however, habitat quality would be dramatically altered by the loss of vegetation. Any other\nfences added for rangeland management (see Section _3.11 Rangeland Resources_ ) would be in\nconformance with CRMP SOP 5 (Common to All).\n\nAs with temporary construction lighting, permanent lighting for operational safety of the Project could\nresult in light pollution in foraging areas for nocturnal species. A Lighting Management Plan would be\ndeveloped with designs for some security lighting during operation, in accordance with PEIS PDF VR2-2\n(minimization of night-sky effects), to minimize the direct and indirect effects of night-lighting on\nwildlife. Long-term adverse effects from lighting to nocturnal wildlife species within the Project site and\nimmediate vicinity would not be expected for the duration of the Project O&M, with implementation of\nthe approved Lighting Management Plan.\n\nRoutine O&M activities are anticipated to result in slight increases in traffic along regional transportation\nroutes as well as internal access roads, which could result in an increased risk of direct mortality of or\ninjury to wildlife from vehicle strikes and increased disturbance from the dust, noise, and ground\nvibrations associated with vehicle use. However, due to the relatively low level of O&M-related vehicle\nuse or disturbance, the risk of increased collisions is low. Additionally, the implementation of Western\nSolar Plan PDFs would minimize the risk of collisions and dust, noise, and vibrations generated from\nvehicle use. These measures include PDF ER2-1, which requires reduced speed limits and carpooling, and\nWestern Solar Plan PDFs SR3-1, SR3-2, and AQC2-1, which require soil monitoring, stabilization, and\nother erosion and dust-control measures and implementation of a Dust Control and Air Quality Plan.\nAdverse impacts from O&M vehicle use would be reduced through these measures.\n\nO&M activities would increase the likelihood of introduction and spread of invasive weeds, which can\nincrease fire risk in wildlife habitat and result in habitat degradation on and off site. The Integrated Weed\nManagement Plan and the Fire Management Plan would reduce the risk of fire and/or habitat degradation\nof surrounding habitat, but the Project would still likely result in a higher cover and density of invasive\nplant species within the Project area and in adjacent habitat over time. Even with these management\nplans, the potential for adverse impacts occurring from the spread of invasive species would remain.\n\nHerbicides would likely be needed to control invasive species, and other hazardous materials could be\nused on site during operations (such as fuel) and could continue to expose wildlife to harmful substances.\nHerbicides would only be used in accordance with an approved PUP and in accordance with the BLM\nManuals and guidance provided in the Western Solar Plan on vegetation treatments using herbicides\n(Abella 2010). Implementation of Western Solar Plan PDF HMW1-1 and the SWPPP, Hazardous\nMaterials and Waste Management Plan, and WEAP would ensure proper use, storage, and spill\nprevention for hazardous materials. Adherence to the measures for proper use, containment, and disposal\nof hazardous waste outlined in these plans would reduce the likelihood of exposure to wildlife.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Big Game Species.** During O&M, the solar site would not be available habitat for big game species due\nto the perimeter fence preventing access and movement through the site. Impacts to pronghorn are\naddressed under construction and the same impacts would persist through O&M regarding loss of habitat.\nThe gen-tie is not expected to deter big game species or change behaviors in its vicinity. Transmission\nlines are already present in the area, including in hunting units near the Fort Churchill Generating Station.\nMM WILD-8 would reduce effects, which includes compensatory mitigation comprised of providing\nfunding to NDOW to support restoration of Summit Spring and Buckbrush Spring south of the Project\nsite that have been degraded by cattle and wild horses.\n\n**Small Mammals.** Impacts to small mammals would be reduced during O&M as compared to those\ndescribed for construction. No new ground disturbance is proposed during O&M, although the loss of\nperennial vegetation cover would result in reduced cover and foraging opportunities for small mammals\nfor the life of the Project and beyond. The Site Restoration and Revegetation plan would include BLMapproved seed mixes that contain some species that provide sources of forage, such as grasses. Given the\nsparse detections of small mammals during surveys, it is likely that even fewer would occupy the Project\nsite during O&M, thus minimizing potential for effects during the operations phase. A Raven\nManagement Plan would also be prepared prior to issuance of a NTP for the Project.\n\n**Bats.** Bat fatalities have been documented at numerous solar projects and studies have begun to\ninvestigate bat mortality in relation to solar developments. A recent study examined mortality rates at 13\nsolar sites across southern California, and determined collisions with solar infrastructure and fencing are\nthe primary cause of death among bats and result in thousands of fatalities a year (Smallwood 2022).\nWhile the potential impact on bats is expected to be minimal given the lack of roosting features within or\nnear the site, ongoing monitoring (to be described in the BLM-required BBCS) would address effects on\nbats from solar development. While these effects would be minimized to the extent practicable, adverse\neffects due to risk of collision and night-lighting would remain adverse.\n\n**Birds** . _Golden Eagles and Migratory Birds_ . Impacts would predominantly be related to foraging habitat\nloss, as described under Construction Impacts, as well as risks of collision with equipment and the gentie. Birds are susceptible to collision and electrocution associated with overhead power lines. The Project\nwould include an overhead gen-tie line up to approximately 24.1 miles in length, part of which is located\nnear the Walker River and Mason Valley WMA. Waterfowl, which fly low and are abundant in the area,\ncould be impacted from collisions. Impacts associated with collision and electrocution would be\nminimized with implementation of Western Solar Plan PDF ER2-1 and CRMP SOP 19 (Common to All),\nwhich requires implementing current guidelines and methodologies in the design of transmission facilities\nto minimize the potential for avian species collision or electrocution. All overhead power lines would be\nconstructed with avian-safe designs in accordance with APLIC suggested practices (APLIC 2006) and, to\nthe extent practicable, tall structures would be sited to avoid known flight paths of avian species. APLIC\nmeasures, including use of marker balls over water crossings and in the vicinity of the Mason Valley\nWMA, would reduce impacts, but some avian deaths from collisions may be unavoidable. The Applicant\nwould also be required to develop a BBCS, including an Avian and Bat Mitigation Monitoring Plan\n(ABMMP), in accordance with MM WILD-5. Monitoring would include overall annual mortality, species\ncomposition, and spatial differentiation based on established searcher efficiency and carcass persistence\ntrials at the site. The BBCS would include monitoring these areas and adaptive management measures if\nhigher than expected mortality is detected. Additional measures may need to be implemented in\ncoordination with NDOW, the BLM, and the USFWS, as appropriate.\n\nThere is concern over the effect large solar installations can have on migrating birds, in particular\nwaterfowl that may mistake the PV solar arrays for waterbodies and try to land (known as the \u201clake\neffect\u201d). The lake effect theory was first described in Horv\u00e1th et al. (2009) as the effects on bird species\nfrom _polarized light pollution_ (PLP) produced by large-scale solar energy projects. PLP refers to highly\nand horizontally polarized light reflected from artificial surfaces, which alters the naturally occurring\npatterns of polarized light experienced by organisms in ecosystems. Utility-scale PV solar facilities may\nattract migrating waterfowl and shorebirds through PLP, whereby migrating birds perceive the reflective\nsurfaces of PV solar panels as bodies of water and collide with the structures as they attempt to land on\n\n\n-----\n\nthe panels (Horv\u00e1th et al. 2009; R. Y. Chock et al. 2021; Kagan et al. 2014; Smallwood 2022; Kosciuch et\nal. 2020; 2021). Many waterfowl species require waterbodies to take off and regain flight, which can\nresult in their becoming stranded in habitats where they cannot survive. This hypothesis is being actively\nstudied as the number and size of utility-scale (>20 MW) solar energy facilities dramatically increases\nacross the southwestern U.S. (R. Y. Chock et al. 2021; Kosciuch et al. 2021; Smallwood 2022). While\nanecdotal reports support this theory, limited relevant research has been conducted to date to evaluate the\nattraction of PV facilities to migrating waterfowl or songbirds.\n\nImpacts to migratory birds would be minimized through implementation of Western Solar Plan PDF\nER3-1. This measure includes turning off all unnecessary lights to avoid attracting migratory birds and\nremoving unoccupied nests from areas that may be dangerous to the species. All nests destroyed or\nremoved during O&M would be reported to the BLM and USFWS, and some would require a permit\nbefore handling, such as those of raptors. The ABMMP included in the BBCS would include reporting\nfatalities associated with powerlines and PV panels as well as overall annual mortality, including species\ncomposition and spatial differentiation. Monitoring plans would be designed to account for seasonal\ndifferences and fatality events of rare species. The WEAP would be provided on a regular basis during\noperation to ensure the continued ecological awareness during all phases of the Project\u2019s life and would\nincorporate adaptive management protocols for addressing ecological changes over the life of the Project,\nshould they occur. Adverse impacts to migratory birds during O&M may occur but would not be expected\nto affect species adversely at the population level.\n\n_Bi-State Sage Grouse_ . No impacts would occur to Bi-State sage grouse, as described under Construction.\n\n_Yellow-billed Cuckoo._ No impacts to yellow-billed cuckoo would occur during O&M. As described under\nConstruction, no yellow-billed cuckoo have been found in the vicinity of the Project; however, the gen-tie\ncrosses the Walker River in one location. During operation, the gen-tie would not directly or indirectly\nimpact yellow-billed cuckoo migration. The gen-tie would be installed above the riparian brush.\n\n**Pollinators and Monarch Butterfly.** Impacts to pollinators would be similar to those described for\nconstruction and would largely result from the removal of native vegetation cover and reduced habitat for\nforaging. The Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan would include measures to reintroduce native plant\nspecies into temporary disturbance areas, including some flowering plants, to provide continued sources\nof forage throughout the O&M phase. While these measures would reduce the effects from habitat loss,\nsome flowering perennial vegetation, such as prickly pear cacti, would be lost but could regenerate during\noperation. Impacts would be reduced through restoration but still could remain adverse. Milkweed along\nthe gen-tie would not be further disturbed during O&M. No additional impacts to monarchs are expected.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nDecommissioning and site reclamation at the end of the life of the Project could result in short-term\nadverse effects to general wildlife and special status wildlife species within and adjacent to the Project\nsite. Decommissioning is anticipated to only directly affect habitat that was previously disturbed during\nthe Project construction and O&M phases and would likely result in fewer direct impacts due to reduced\nhabitat likely at the time of decommissioning. Temporary disturbances to wildlife and special status\nwildlife species from noise, dust and dust suppression, ground vibrations, and humans and vehicles\nassociated with decommissioning would be comparable to those from construction. The use of heavy\nequipment and other activities associated with decommissioning would result in impacts to wildlife\nsimilar to those described above for construction, including injury, mortality, or avoidance behavior.\n\nFollowing decommissioning activities and removal of the perimeter fence, wildlife species would be able\nto access and move through the Project site. However, desert ecosystems can take decades to a century or\nmore to recover from disturbance (Abella 2010), and long-term habitat quality would be degraded, which\ncould have persistent adverse impacts on wildlife populations and adjacent habitat. Restoration following\nconstruction per the Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan and Western Solar Plan PDFs would set the\nProject site on a trajectory to regain native species cover and habitat function; however, restoration is a\nlong, slow process in desert environments, and it would likely still take several decades following\ndecommissioning for the site to regain full habitat function for wildlife (Lovich and Ennen 2011; Abella\n\n\n-----\n\net. al 2021). Even with PDFs and a Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan and Decommissioning and\nSite Reclamation Plan, the overall impacts to wildlife from decommissioning the Project would remain\nadverse, but given the scale of surrounding similar habitat, it is not expected that wildlife would be\nconsiderably affected.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nA number of projects and other management actions in the region would contribute to cumulative impacts\nto wildlife, including other existing and proposed utility-scale solar development projects, transmission\nlines, and mining located on other BLM and private lands. Similar to the Project, these cumulative\nprojects would involve ground disturbance and vegetation clearing and would also likely result in habitat\ndegradation and disturbances to wildlife. The cumulative projects could result in increased fire frequency\nor intensity from a combination of abundant invasive plant fuels, higher likelihood of anthropogenic\nignitions, and introduction of solar infrastructure with ecosystem effects, adversely affecting sensitive\nplant communities and wildlife (Abella et. al 2021; Chambers et al. 2013; Grodsky et. al 2020b).\nConstruction and O&M of the cumulative projects considered could also directly harm or kill wildlife or\ncause avoidance or other changes in behavior. Direct and indirect cumulative effects on wildlife could\noccur from herbicide use, dust and dust suppression, noise, lighting, spread of invasive species, and other\nchanges in the area. Cumulative impacts to golden eagles could occur from aggregated loss of foraging\nareas. Security fencing around the perimeter of other solar development sites would be similar to that of\nthe Project and would result in movement barriers for some wildlife across the region. The cumulative\neffects would be adverse. The Project would involve the use of equipment and vehicles that could directly\nor indirectly harm wildlife during construction and O&M and would result in habitat loss, also similar to\nthe cumulative projects. The Project would contribute to the adverse cumulative effects on wildlife.\nImplementation of various management plans and mitigations, including the Lighting Management Plan,\nPUP, and MMs WILD-1 through WILD-5, however, would reduce the Project\u2019s contribution to\ncumulative adverse effects.\n\n**_3.8.4.3_** **_Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\nWith the reduction in areas of permanent impacts through grading and a maximum threshold set for native\nperennial vegetation loss, Alternative 1 would result in reduced impacts to wildlife and special status\nwildlife species and habitat within the Project site. While the Project components would remain the same,\nthis reduction in permanent disturbance areas (from 64 percent of the application area to ultimately, 35\npercent) would allow for more areas of native habitat to remain undisturbed and allow for quicker\nrecovery in disturbed areas. Larger areas of native plant communities would be preserved and reduced\nareas of heavy soil disturbance would likely reduce invasive species infestations and loss of the soil seed\nbank. Natural plant recruitment would be likely to occur in areas constructed using drive and crush. The\nduration of disturbance to wildlife from construction activities (e.g., noise, dust, human presence, hazards\nfrom equipment and vehicle use) would be similar as for the Proposed Action (with an approximate time\nextension of 2 months), but the intensity would be reduced due to smaller areas of vegetation removal and\nground disturbance. Reducing disturbance would also help to preserve functional wildlife habitat and\nreduce the potential for the introduction of invasive weeds and fugitive dust from construction. Ground\ndisturbance would still be expected to adversely affect burrowing species and ground-nesting birds;\nhowever, Alternative 1 would benefit these species by minimizing habitat loss and allowing some level of\ncontinued nesting and burrowing within the Project site as compared to the Proposed Action. Larger areas\nof functional habitat would also support prey species for predators (e.g., coyotes and foxes) and raptors,\nincluding golden eagles. During Project O&M, fenced corridors would be maintained throughout the\nProject site, which would remain open to allow larger animals, such as big game species, to move\nthrough. This feature would increase the availability of the site for migration of species that would be too\nlarge to access the site under the Proposed Action.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis alternative would reduce the overall adverse impacts to wildlife and special status species from the\ndevelopment of the solar site but would not eliminate them. All Western Solar Plan PDFs, the CRMP\nSOPs, MMs, and management plans required by the BLM for mitigating negative impacts to wildlife and\nspecial status species from Project construction would remain the same as those identified for the\nProposed Action.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\nDuring the 30-year Project lifespan, vegetation would be maintained throughout the solar site and would\nprovide wildlife habitat. Because more native vegetation would be preserved and/or restored during\nO&M, more vegetation maintenance (i.e., trimming) could be required under this alternative, which could\nimpact wildlife in the Project site. Vegetation would be trimmed as needed to prevent interference or\nsafety issues with the solar array components, which would also reduce cover and forage opportunities.\nWhile there is some concern that preserving more areas of habitat could increase the potential for harm to\nwildlife from the solar facility (e.g., collisions with equipment or disturbance during maintenance\nactivities), the long-term benefits of habitat preservation and reduced fragmentation beyond the Project\nlifespan outweigh the risks. Reduced disturbance areas would require less dust abatement and herbicide\nuse, and Western Solar Plan PDFs for the protection of wildlife would be adhered to. These measures\ninclude PDF ER 3-2, which requires project proponents to manage projects to minimize impacts to\nwildlife during O&M, employing an adaptive management strategy as necessary and approved by the\nBLM.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nDecommissioning under Alternative 1 is anticipated to affect areas previously disturbed during Project\nconstruction. Decommissioning would result in direct and indirect impacts to wildlife and special status\nwildlife species similar to those described for construction for this alternative. With less impactful\nconstruction methods, vegetation communities would likely recover more quickly during O&M, resulting\nin more areas of suitable habitat and thereby increasing potential for direct impacts to wildlife during\ndecommissioning. These impacts would be short-term, and site reclamation would be more successful due\nto fewer areas of permanent disturbance. Habitat within the Project area would recover more easily after\ndecommissioning than under the Proposed Action (Abella 2010; Chambers et al. 2013; Hernandez et al.\n2014; Lovich and Bainbridge 1999). Even though short-term impacts could be greater during\ndecommissioning under this alternative, restoration of these habitats would likely be more successful,\nwith reduced long-term impacts to wildlife habitat. Implementation of the Site Decommissioning and\nReclamation Plan and Western Solar Plan PDFs as described for the Proposed Action would further\nreduce potential adverse effects on wildlife from decommissioning.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nAlterative 1 would still have adverse impacts, but the reduced Project impacts would result in fewer\ncumulative effects on wildlife and habitats within the analysis area. Because the anticipated recovery time\npost-Project is expected to be much less for this alternative (5\u201310 years as opposed to hundreds of years),\ncumulative adverse impacts to the area (specifically, wildlife habitat) would be reduced over time.\nRetaining vegetation would also improve habitat resiliency for adapting to climate change, as compared\nto the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.8.4.4_** **_Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\n\nConstruction, O&M, and decommissioning impacts from this alternative would be the same as described\nfor the Proposed Action for the solar site and gen-tie. Differences in impacts could occur from the use of\nsupplemental access routes. These routes have already been disturbed, and habitats adjacent to the roads\nwould not be expected to provide high quality habitat for wildlife. No upgrades or new disturbance would\nbe associated with the use of supplemental access roads, so there would be no direct disturbance to\nwildlife habitat from use. However, the use of additional roads would disperse traffic within the Mason\nValley and could increase disturbances to wildlife from noise and dust and could increase the risk of\nvehicle collisions. Because these roads are currently used and maintained, it is unlikely that these effects\nwould be noticeable beyond existing conditions. The routes would only regularly be used as supplemental\n\n\n-----\n\naccess during Project construction, which would be short-term (approximately 16 months), so any\nimpacts from increased traffic on these routes would be temporary. The supplemental routes would not be\nused during O&M, so no additional impacts to wildlife would occur during O&M. Depending on the\ntiming, supplemental access may be used during decommissioning, as well, but is not expected to result in\nimpacts beyond those of construction. This alternative would contribute to cumulative adverse impacts to\nwildlife as described for the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.8.4.5_** **_Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\n\n**Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Decommissioning Impacts**\nConstruction, O&M, and decommissioning impacts from this alternative would be the same as described\nfor the Proposed Action for the solar site and the access road. The gen-tie would be reduced from a\n24.1-mile-long line from the solar site to the Fort Churchill substation to a 0.54-mile-long line extending\nfrom the eastern boundary of the solar site to a new switching station under the Greenlink West line. This\nwould result in just under 12 acres of permanent disturbance to habitat for wildlife, representing a\nreduction of 92 acres of permanent disturbance and 100 acres of temporary disturbance to habitat\ncompared with the Proposed Action. Direct and indirect impacts to wildlife from construction, O&M, and\ndecommissioning would be reduced under this alternative given the much smaller impact footprint and\nlength of the gen-tie. This alternative would also avoid disturbance and operation of a transmission line\nnear sensitive riparian habitats along the Walker River and the Mason Valley WMA, eliminating potential\nimpacts to golden eagle, migratory birds (including western yellow-billed cuckoo), bats, monarch\nbutterflies and pollinators, and big game species in that area.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nCumulative impacts to wildlife would be similar to the Proposed Action. There would be no construction\nof the 24.1-mile gen-tie line, which would reduce the Project\u2019s contribution to native vegetation\ndisturbance and removal within the Mason Valley. The difference in impacts would be small as the solar\nfield would contribute the largest cumulative loss of habitat within the analysis area.\n\n**_3.8.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the Project would not be constructed, and existing land uses would\ncontinue. The BLM would continue to manage the land consistent with the CRMP. There would be no\nimpacts to wildlife from Project implementation, and existing habitat conditions and trends would remain.\n\n**_3.8.4.7_** **_Relevant Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP Standard_**\n**_Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nPDFs from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project would comply with the\nfollowing PDFs to minimize impacts to wildlife:\n\n-  AQC 2-1\n\n-  ER1-1, ER2-1, ER3-1, ER3-2, ER4-1\n\n-  HMW1-1\n\n-  SR2-1, SR3-1, SR3-2, SR4-1, SR4-2, SR4-3\n\n-  VR 2-2\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nSOPs from the CRMP are listed in Appendix B. The following SOPs were identified for the protection of\nwildlife resources:\n\n-  Common to All SOPs 5, 6, 9, 19, 22\n\n\n-----\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans required by the BLM ROW grant would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize impacts to wildlife resources:\n\n-  Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan (Draft available on the Project website)\n\n-  Integrated Weed Management Plan (Draft available on the Project website)\n\n-  Workers Environmental Awareness Program\n\n-  Lighting Management Plan (Draft available on the Project website)\n\n-  Dust Control and Air Quality Plan (Draft available on the Project website)\n\n-  Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Plan\n\n-  Bird and Bat Conservation Strategy (Draft available on the Project website)\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts on\nwildlife resources:\n\n**MM WILD-1: Biological Monitoring**\n\nThe Applicant shall designate a BLM-approved biologist to be responsible for overseeing compliance\nwith mitigation measures related to the protection of ecological resources throughout all Project phases,\nparticularly in areas requiring avoidance or containing sensitive biological resources, such as special\nstatus species. Additional qualified biological monitors may be required on site during all Project phases\nas needed to ensure protection of sensitive resources.\n\n**MM WILD-2: Worker Environmental Awareness Program**\n\nWEAP training shall include identification and protection of ecological resources, including knowledge\nof mitigation measures required by federal, State, and local agencies.\n\n**MM WILD-3: Elimination of Wildlife Hiding Locations**\n\nThe number of areas where wildlife could hide or be trapped (e.g., open sheds, pits, uncovered basins,\nlaydown areas) shall be minimized. For example, an uncovered pipe that has been placed in a trench shall\nbe capped at the end of each workday to prevent animals from entering the pipe. If a special status species\nis discovered inside a component, that component must not be moved or, if necessary, moved only to\nremove the animal from the path of activity until the animal has escaped. Workers shall not approach or\nfeed wildlife.\n\n**MM WILD-4: Elimination of Conflicts with Wildlife**\n\nAccess roads shall be appropriately constructed, improved, maintained, and provided with signs to\nminimize potential wildlife/vehicle collisions and facilitate wildlife movement through the Project site.\nProject vehicle speeds shall be limited in areas occupied by special status animal species. Appropriate\nspeed limits shall be determined through coordination with federal and State resource management\nagencies. Traffic shall be required to stop to allow wildlife to crossroads. Unless authorized, personnel\nshall not attempt to move live, injured, or dead wildlife off roads, ROWs, or the Project site. Honking\nhorns, revving engines, yelling, and excessive speed are inappropriate and considered a form of\nharassment. If traffic is being unreasonably delayed by wildlife in roads, personnel shall contact the\nProject biologist and security, who shall take any necessary action. Pet animals shall not be permitted on\nthe Project site.\n\nIf any approved-PUP allowable chemicals are used in the construction-water storage ponds that are not\nbird or wildlife compatible, or if injuries to birds occur due to increased flocking at the ponds, the ponds\nshall be fitted with exclusion devices such as floating balls or fencing. Textured material shall be placed\non the bottom of the ponds to minimize the likelihood of wildlife drowning.\n\n**MM WILD-5: Bird and Bat Conservation Strategy Requirements**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BBCS shall include a robust systematic monitoring and adaptive management plan to assist in\navoiding and minimizing Project impacts on migratory birds. The monitoring shall include overall annual\nmortality, species composition, and spatial differentiation based on established searcher efficiency and\ncarcass persistence trials, being established through other studies at solar facilities, at the site and shall be\ndesigned to account for seasonal differences and fatality events of rare species.\n\n**MM WILD-6: Nesting Bird Avoidance and Minimization**\n\nHabitat-altering activities shall be avoided during bird breeding season (February 15\u2013August 31) to the\nextent possible. If a Project-related activity must occur during the breeding season, a qualified biologist\nshall survey the area for nests immediately prior to commencing construction activities. The surveys shall\ninclude burrowing and ground-nesting species in addition to those nesting in vegetation. If any active\nnests are found, an appropriately sized buffer area shall be established in coordination with the BLM and\nmaintained until the young birds fledge. This buffer shall be required to connect to another suitable\nundisturbed habitat. The above dates are a general guideline, and any active nests observed outside of this\nrange shall also be avoided. If burrowing owls are suspected (e.g., along the gen-tie), pre-construction\nsurveys shall be conducted in accordance with the USFWS\u2019s latest burrowing owl guidance. If an active\nnest is identified, construction activities shall cease within 250 feet of the burrowing owl nest location to\nprevent disturbance until the chicks have fledged or the nest has been abandoned, as determined by a\nqualified biologist. Buffers may be increased or reduced as needed with the approval of the BLM and\nUSFWS. For western yellow-billed cuckoo, a limited operating period (LOP) shall be implemented from\nJune through August if this species is located within 0.5 mile of work areas during pre-construction\nsurveys or monitoring. All construction activities within 0.5 miles shall cease until the LOP has ended, or\na qualified biologist has determined the species is no longer present.\n\n**MM WILD-7: Protection of Native Pollinators and Monarch Butterflies**\n\nPrior to construction, pre-construction surveys shall include identification of locations of bee\noverwintering sites and milkweed ( _Asclepias_ spp.). Ground disturbance or noise shall be avoided near bee\noverwintering sites, particularly during peak foraging and breeding. Milkweed shall be flagged for\navoidance. Herbicides with long residual toxicities and long-lived toxic nitroguanidine neonicotinoids\nshall not be used within the Project area, and herbicides shall only be applied during appropriate weather\nwindows (wind <10 mph, in mornings or evenings or when cool temperatures reduce likelihood of\nevaporation). Seed mixes used for restoration shall include species of flowering plants to provide\ncontinued sources of foraging for pollinators.\n\n**MM WILD-8: Pronghorn Antelope Compensatory Mitigation**\n\nThe Applicant shall work with NDOW to provide funding to support restoration of two springs south of\nthe Project site that have been degraded by cattle and wild horses, including Summit Spring and\nBuckbrush Spring. The funding shall be applied towards upgraded fencing and development of water\ntroughs for horses and cattle outside the fencing. All work may require its own NEPA analysis and the\nappropriate BLM authorization/decision.\n\n**_3.8.4.8 Irreversible, Irretrievable, and Residual Impacts_**\nIrreversible or irretrievable impacts are those that cannot be reversed or recovered. The Proposed Action\nwould result in irreversible or irretrievable impacts on up to 3,420 acres of wildlife habitat across the\ndevelopment area. Alternative 1 would reduce the long-term loss of that habitat to approximately\n1,903 acres. Site reclamation, even with substantial effort, is not expected to restore these impacted areas\nto pre-Project conditions. Restoration could take decades to centuries on a project of this size (especially\nin an arid environment), and repeated restoration efforts would be necessary. Many species, such as cacti\nand other perennial vegetation, would not be expected to recolonize the site, and changes to native species\ncomposition and habitat would be permanent. Permanent adverse impacts to wildlife habitat would\nremain, even with mitigation measures, but Alternative 1 would substantially reduce the impacts in\ncomparison to the Proposed Action.\n\n\n-----\n\nResidual impacts to wildlife would occur within the Project area. The area would be maintained with a\nperimeter security fence for the duration of the Project, which would contribute to habitat fragmentation\nfor larger species not able to access or move through the site. Residual impacts under the Proposed Action\nalso include the long-term alteration of over approximately 3,420 acres of native wildlife habitat, which\nwould reduce overall regional habitat. Indirect impacts to wildlife habitat from the Project (e.g., fugitive\ndust, spread of invasive weed species) would persist even with the Western Solar Plan PDFs, the BLMrequired management plans, and MMs. While these measures would reduce impacts for the duration of\nconstruction, O&M, and decommissioning of the Project, they would not eliminate them. Alternative 1\nwould substantially reduce the residual impacts as compared to the Proposed Action.\n\n##### 3.9 Water Resources\n\n**3.9.1 Introduction**\nThis section presents the potential impacts on water resources from construction, O&M, and\ndecommissioning of the Project. The water resources within the Project area include surface water and\ngroundwater. Both surface waters and groundwater are managed through a variety of State and federal\nrules and regulations pertaining to the quantity and quality of the waters and through a program of water\nrights pertaining to the distribution of water resources.\n\nThe information in this section is based on the following studies:\n\n-  Preliminary Drainage Study: Libra Solar Project, Mineral County, Nevada, June 16, 2023\n(Westwood 2023a).\n\n-  Libra Solar Project: Informational Summary of Water Rights, Supply, and Use, June 2023\n(Panorama 2023).\n\n-  Draft Groundwater Impact Analysis Report, Libra Solar Project, Mineral County, Nevada, June\n2023 (West Yost 2023).\n\n-  Aquatic Resources Delineation Report (Phoenix 2022).\n\nSurface and groundwater are managed under the following regulations.\n\n-  All waters in Nevada are public property and are subject to the laws described in NRS Chapters\n532 through 538.\n\n-  The Nevada Division of Water Resources (NDWR), led by the State Engineer, is responsible for\nmanaging surface and groundwater resources, including overseeing water right applications,\nappropriations, and intercounty and interbasin transfers (NDWR 2010).\n\n-  The Clean Water Act (33 USC \u00a71251\u20131387) is the primary law protecting water quality in surface\nwaters by limiting polluting discharges.\n\n-  Executive Order 11990 Protection of Wetlands provides additional protections to wetlands (OFR\n1977b).\n\n-  Executive Order 11988 Floodplain Management provides additional protections to floodplains\n(OFR 1977a).\n\n-  Mineral and Lyon counties participate in the National Flood Insurance Program created through\nthe National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.\n\n-  Mineral County Code Section 17.37.020 (L)-(M).\n\n**3.9.2 Analysis Area**\nThe analysis area for surface water resources, including waters potentially within U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers (USACOE) jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, consists of the 5,141-acre solar site, the\nentire gen-tie alignment, the access roads, and downstream areas in the Mason Valley. This analysis area\nconsiders all anticipated surface-water-impacting activities associated with the Project. The analysis area\n\n\n-----\n\nfor groundwater and water consumption consists of the Project area and the Mason Valley Hydrographic\nUnit (Basin 9-108) (Figure 3.9-1), also referred to as the Mason Valley Hydrographic Basin, which is\nbounded by the Desert Mountains to the north, the Wassuk Range to the east, the Cambridge Hills and\nGray Hills to the south, and the Singatse Range to the west.\n\n**3.9.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.9.3.1 Surface Water_**\n\n**Onsite Conditions**\nThe Project solar site is located on Black Mountain Well and Pumpkin Hollow Hydrologic Unit Code\n(HUC)-12s, [4] and is at the foot of Black Mountain. The solar site is relatively flat with slopes of less than\n3 percent; however, this slope is exceeded in some locations. Many braided washes flow westward\nthrough the solar site, including washes that originate on the solar site. All washes within the analysis area\nhave an ephemeral flow regime, only conveying flow during heavy precipitation events (see Section _3.3_\n_Air Quality and Climate Change_ for a description of climate); however, some of the washes may also\nconvey snowmelt in years with heavy snowfall. The ephemeral drainages found along the access road and\nsolar site have shallow gradients, and banks are comprised of silty or sandy sediment. No evidence of\ngroundwater discharges to the surface, such as from springs or seeps, has been observed during field\nstudies within the solar site. A cluster of active springs are located between the Gray Hills and the Wassuk\nRange, about 2.5 to 3.5 miles southeast and east of the solar site. These springs drain groundwater from the\nfractured basement rocks of the Wassuk Range (West Yost 2023).\n\nThe access road would cross the East Walker River, a perennial river, as well as two irrigation ditches,\napproximately 0.5 mile east of the intersection with SR 208. This area is near an existing residence and\nhas a well-developed riparian corridor around the river. The remainder of the access road would cross\nnumerous dry washes, including a large dry wash located approximately 1.9 miles east of the intersection\nof East Walker Road with Reese River Road, along Reese River Road. The gen-tie would also cross\nnumerous ephemeral drainages and the main stem of the Walker River in its northern extent.\n\n**Jurisdictional Waters**\nAn Aquatic Resources Delineation Report (Phoenix 2022) has been provided to the USACOE and is\nawaiting approval. During the initial field delineation, conducted in June 2022, no wetlands were\nidentified along the surveyed areas, which included the solar site and the access road. However, 520\nephemeral desert wash channels (non-relatively permanent water [RPW]) with ordinary high watermark\n( OHWM) characteristics were identified within the solar site and access road buffer. Three hundred and\nninety-three (393) of these features, totaling 562,520 linear feet, were identified within the Project solar\nsite and access road. One hundred and twenty-seven (127) of these features, totaling 7,555 linear feet,\nwere within the access road buffer. The main OHWM indicators include change in sediment texture,\nchange in vegetation cover, and presence of bed and bank. The washes have low vegetation cover due to\nstorm discharge events, lack of developed soils, and well-drained coarse soil textures that lack soil\nmoisture. Species found within the dry washes were also found in adjacent upland habitats.\n\n4 Watersheds are delineated by USGS using a nationwide system based on surface hydrologic features. This system\ndivides the country into 22 regions (2-digit), 245 subregions (4-digit), 405 basins (6-digit), ~2,400 subbasins (8-digit),\n~19,000 watersheds (10-digit), and ~105,000 subwatersheds (12-digit). A hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC)\nconsisting of 2 additional digits for each level in the hydrologic unit system is used to identify any hydrologic area.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.9-1** **Mason Valley Hydrologic Basin**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe gen-tie alignment was surveyed in June 2023, along with the proposed access road improvements.\nNine wetlands totaling 5.4 acres were delineated within the northern part of the gen-tie alignment west\nand east of the East Walker River. These features are defined as palustrine emergent wetlands and\npalustrine shrub-scrub wetlands, which are non-riverine wetlands characterized by the presence of\nstanding water or saturated soil. In addition to these wetland features, 251 streams totaling 91,958 linear\nfeet and 19.2 acres were delineated within the gen-tie and additional access road survey areas. All of the\nstreams appeared to be ephemeral washes except for the East Walker River, which is perennial.\n\nThe washes and irrigation ditches in the basin drain towards the Walker River, but not all meet the\nWalker River. The Walker River originates in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California and flows over\n60 miles until it enters Walker Lake in Nevada, which is a terminal lake. The East Walker and Walker\nrivers originate in California, and thus are jurisdictional, navigable waters. However, the washes within\nthe solar site and that cross Reese River Road are not known to be jurisdictional as they lose their banks\nand spread over the surface to the west of the Project area. Once the drainages lose their bed and banks,\nthere is no longer a direct hydrologic connection to the East Walker or Walker Rivers. A hydrologic\nnexus to the Walker River, therefore, was not identified for the washes within the solar site.\n\nJurisdictional waters are likely limited to the northern portion of the gen-tie, within the Walker River\nWMA and where it crosses the Walker River. Additional information on the surface waters found in the\nProject area (including the access road, solar site, and gen-tie) are included in the Final Aquatic Resources\nDelineation Report (Phoenix 2022) .\n\n**Floodplains**\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has not completed a study to determine flood\nhazards for the Project area; the Project is covered by Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) panels\n32032C0300C and 32021C0500C. The Project area contains areas of FEMA Zone D flood hazards.\nFEMA Zone D areas are where flood hazards are possible but are undetermined as no flood hazard\nanalysis has been conducted. No preliminary or pending FEMA changes are proposed within the Project\narea.\n\n**_3.9.3.2 Groundwater_**\n\n**Groundwater Resources**\nRegionally, groundwater flows northward through the Mason Valley Hydrographic Unit, following the\nflow direction of Walker River (Huxel and Harris 1969). Groundwater movement within the Mason\nValley Hydrographic Unit is primarily controlled by topography and flows from the exposed mountain\nblocks towards the center of local flats and valleys, and ultimately towards the Walker River.\nGroundwater through the Project solar site flows toward the north and west. Faults in the area may\nfunction as either barriers or conduits for groundwater flow.\n\nThe main source of groundwater recharge in the basin is the percolation of irrigation water derived primarily\nfrom diversions of the Walker River, with some local recharge from snowmelt in the Wassuk Range.\nDischarge from springs northeast of the Buck Brush Spring Fault and within the Wassuk fault block not\nused under existing water rights for grazing stock water, either pond or flow northwest through the valley\nfill and percolate to recharge the groundwater aquifer. Surface water seeping through the Walker River\nchannel also contributes on a smaller scale to aquifer recharge, and so does about 1 percent of the annual\nprecipitation.\n\nIrrigation makes up about 86 percent of groundwater usage in the Mason Valley Hydrographic Unit\n(NDWR 2022), followed by industrial use (4.3 percent), recreation (4 percent), and municipal supply (<\n2 percent). The city of Yerington pumps its municipal water through four public supply wells\napproximately 18 miles northwest of the Project solar site. Groundwater wells nearer to the Project area\nare located along the East Walker River, along the mainstem Walker River, and at the Nevada Copper\nPumpkin Hollow Mine (as shown in Figure 3.9-2). Most of these wells are used for monitoring or\ndewatering and are constructed within the basement bedrock.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.9-2** **Groundwater Basins in the Proposed Project Area**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe depth to groundwater highly varies across the Mason Valley, with water levels nearest to the surface\nfound in proximity to the Walker River. The closest monitoring wells to the Project area are located on\nthe Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine, north of the Project solar site. These monitoring wells show a decline\nin groundwater levels over the last decade, with levels in 2022 at 300 to over 500 feet or deeper for the\nsouthernmost wells closest to the Project solar site (NDWR 2023). Groundwater under the solar site is\nalso expected to be several hundred feet below ground surface (bgs). Further west and north in the basin,\nnear the East Walker and Walker Rivers, groundwater is only a few feet bgs. Additional detail is provided\nin the Groundwater Impact Analysis Report (West Yost 2023).\n\n**Groundwater Rights**\n**Overview.** Nevada water rights are guided by two principles: the prior appropriations doctrine and the\nconcept of beneficial use (NDWR n.d.) [5] . A water right establishes an appropriation amount and priority\ndate. Water rights are treated as both real and personal property and can be transferred independent of\nland ownership rights.(Hecox 2001) The amount of groundwater available for extraction, and therefore\npermitting, is based on the _perennial yield_ , which is the maximum amount of groundwater that can be\nsalvaged (i.e., extracted) each year over the long term without depleting the groundwater reservoir and\nthat does not exceed the natural recharge to the aquifer. The Mason Valley Hydrographic Basin is critical\nmanagement area under N.R.S. \u00a7 534.110, referred to as a designated basin, having an estimated\nperennial yield of 25,000 acre-feet (NDWR 2022) but committed groundwater resources of 145,346 acrefeet per year. No new allocations of surface water or groundwater are available from this basin. This means\nthat the Applicant must find a water right from existing allocations or from sources outside the basin.\n\n**Temporary Uses and Transfers in Designated Basins.** One method of obtaining water for the Project\nincludes leasing or buying water rights and requesting a temporary change of use. NRS \u00a7533.345\nspecifically allows temporary or permanent change of the direction, manner, or use of existing\ngroundwater rights, creating a pathway by which new water uses could be accommodated in a designated\nbasin including temporary changes up to 3 years for renewable energy generation projects.\n\n**Intercounty Transfers.** Another pathway to acquiring water for the Proposed Project is obtaining water\nfrom other counties or basins. Using this path requires county notification, public hearings, and ultimately\napproval from both the State Engineer and counties involved, per NRS \u00a7533.363 (NDWR 1999).\n\n**3.9.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.9.4.1 Methods_**\n\n**Surface Water**\nSurface water flow was modeled using FLO-2D, an industry-accepted physical process model appropriate\nfor estimating hydrological parameters based on input parameters including rainfall, topography, and\ngroundcover. A FLO-2D model with 50-foot grid cells was utilized to model the watershed within and\ndirectly impacting the Project solar site. A FLO-2D model with 100-foot grid cells was used to model the\nlarger area outside of the Project solar site that impacts the access road and gen-tie alignment. The\nelevation data that was used was a blend of 10-meter digital elevation map (DEM) data from the USGS\nData Gateway, NextMAP Intermap 5-meter data, 5-meter DEM data from USGS Scientific Data Center,\nand 1-foot flown data. The 10-meter DEM data from Data Gateway was used for topographic coverage of\nthe central 45,000 acres surrounding the access roads, the 5-meter DEM data from the Scientific Data\nCenter was used for topographic coverage of the eastern 98,000 acres, and the 1-foot flown data was used\nto cover the solar site. This data was exported as a single digital terrain model, which is read directly into\nFLO-2D to provide the drainage volume and velocity baseline conditions and conditions with Proposed\n\n5 Examples of beneficial uses include irrigation, mining, stock watering as well as recreation, commercial, industrial,\nand municipal uses.\n\n\n-----\n\nAction and alternatives. The assumptions and model inputs of the analysis are detailed in the Preliminary\nDrainage Study (Westwood 2023a).\n\n**Groundwater**\nThe potential effects of the Project on groundwater, primarily from groundwater pumping for\nconstruction, O&M, and decommissioning water, were assessed using the USGS groundwater model\nWTAQ (Barlow and Moench 1999). WTAQ is a computer program that implements an analytical\nsolution for drawdown due to pumping from a partially penetrating well in a homogenous, anisotropic\naquifer. The program provides drawdown results at discrete points in time and space. It was used to\nprepare contour maps of the simulated groundwater level drawdown at the end of construction of the\nProject and hydrographs of the simulated groundwater level drawdown and recovery induced by Project\npumping during construction, O&M, and decommissioning. The assumptions and model inputs of the\nanalysis are detailed in the groundwater impacts analysis report (West Yost 2023).\n\n**_3.9.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction and O&M Impacts**\n**Surface Water.** Surface grading and removal of vegetation would disturb ephemeral washes and alter\ndrainage patterns during both construction and the O&M phase of the Project. Potential impacts include\n(1) changes in water quality, primarily from transport of sediments, and also due to potential chemical\nreleases from equipment or herbicides; and (2) increased risks of flooding on-site and downstream from\nincreased surface flows to the major washes.\n\n_Water Quality and Sedimentation._ Sedimentation risks are highest during construction, as construction\ninvolves continuous soil disturbance. In accordance with the Construction Stormwater General Permit\nNVR100000, a SWPPP would be prepared and implemented during construction, which would include\ninstallation of site-specific erosion control BMPs as part of the site preparation process. Western Solar\nPlan PDF SR2-1 also requires BMPs to minimize soil erosion (BLM and U.S. DOE 2012, app. A). BMPs\ninclude, but are not limited to, controlling water runoff and directing it to temporary settling basins during\nconstruction; minimizing vegetation removal only to areas of active construction; recontouring and\nrevegetating Project roads that are no longer needed to increase filtration; and using temporary\nstabilization (e.g., erosion matting blankets, soil stabilizing agents such as dust palliatives) for areas that\nare not actively under construction and along high use unpaved roads. BMPs would be implemented\nthroughout construction to reduce erosion and subsequent sedimentation of washes. The washes level out\nto sheet flows (i.e., lose their beds and banks) downstream of the solar site before reaching any water\nbodies, including before reaching the manmade feature, High Ditch. Accordingly, increased sediment\ntransport is not anticipated to have adverse effects during construction. Western Solar Plan WR1-1 would\nrequire that Project site drainage, erosion, and sedimentation related to stormwater runoff is minimized,\nand the CRMP SOPs 4, 7, 10, and 18 (Common to All) require rehabilitation and restoration of disturbed\nareas to minimize soil erosion (BLM 2001). To further reduce potential for effect, MM SOILS-1 would\nrequire that the Applicant implement phasing of disturbance in order to minimize the amount of area of\ndestabilized soils at a time. Phasing would include ground disturbance and development of roads, pads,\nand infrastructure in up to 1,000-acre units at a time. The areas would likely be developed to the point that\narray posts are installed, and then the ground stabilized, before opening the next 1,000 acres of\ndevelopment. This measure would reduce the amount of soils subject to water erosion and thus\ndownstream sedimentation.\n\nWidening of Reese River Road and creation of road spurs and access roads for the gen-tie, as well as\ninstalling gen-tie poles, could also provide a new source of stormwater runoff and sedimentation during\nconstruction. The northern end of the gen-tie alignment would cross the Walker River through a riparian\narea and over open water. The gen-tie line would span the open water, and poles would be sited to\nminimize effects to riparian habitat. The CRMP SOP 10 (Common to All) requires implementation of\nmeasures to reduce the potential for pollution or siltation of the Walker River and surrounding areas. The\nSWPPP would also apply to the construction of the gen-tie and the access road work and, thus, would\nreduce effects. Construction of portions of the gen-tie in the vicinity of the Walker River could require a\n\n\n-----\n\nClean Water Act Section 404 Nationwide Permit (NWP) and a Section 401 Certification if any fill of\njurisdictional drainages were to occur. The conditions of the NWP and 401 permit would apply, including\nsimilar measures to and including the SWPPP, and would reduce potential effects. In terms of use of the\naccess road during construction but also during O&M, sediments may flow off of East Walker Road into\nwaters that flow to the East Walker River. East Walker Road, however, would not be widened, reducing\nthose risks during construction. The first 1.5 miles of East Walker Road may be resurfaced or paved, as\ndetermined in coordination with Lyon County and the two homeowners along the road. The road, while\nnot currently paved, is compacted and thus, once it is paved, would experience similar runoff conditions.\nUnder MM WR-1, the Applicant would work with Lyon County to ensure adequate road drainage and a\nmaintenance plan for construction and O&M for the road to address any erosion before it can cause\nsedimentation or off-road impacts to the surrounding land and water. This measure would reduce the\npotential for adverse effects from sedimentation on the East Walker River.\n\nDuring construction and O&M, for all Project components (the solar site, the access road, and the gentie), fuel, herbicide, and other chemical spills and accidents could occur. A SPCCP would be developed\nprior to construction in accordance with regulations, which would address spills associated with fuel\ntanks. The SWPPP would also establish procedures to minimize the effect of accidental releases of other\nhazardous materials on water quality. Herbicides would only be applied in accordance with a PUP and\nIntegrated Weed Management Plan to ensure that water quality is protected. Although spills could still\noccur, the likelihood of occurrence is considered low. Effects would be short-term and localized if a spill\nwere to occur and would not have lasting effects on regional water quality. Ponds (or tanks) would be\ncreated to hold water, which would primarily be used for dust control during construction. Water could be\nsourced from an on-site well. The ponds, if used, would be designed with a liner and berms to ensure that\nthe water remains only in the ponds. The ponds could overflow and increase runoff and sedimentation of\nwaterways during a storm event. Per MM WR-2, the ponds would be designed with appropriate freeboard\nand/or spillways and flow dissipation to ensure that water is held or properly discharged during a storm\nevent without causing excessive sedimentation. Water retention basins (i.e., stormwater features) would\nbe constructed on site as well and would also serve to reduce off-site sediment transport during\nconstruction and O&M.\n\n_Flooding._ Adverse on- or off-site flooding as a result of construction activities or during O&M is not\nexpected. Based on the Flow2D modeling performed for the Project, flows are predicted to remain\nconfined in established washes for the 6-hour, 100-year storm event and below. Stormwater flow depths\nand volumes and flow rates from the 100-year storm event were analyzed as the likely worst-case\nscenario. Figure 3.9-3 through Figure 3.9-6 present the existing 6-hour, 100-year flow rates and the\nProject development flow rates and depths for the Project site given removal of 64 percent of the\nvegetation and maintenance of the existing drainage network. The results show that even during a\n100-year storm event, the flood depths across the majority of the Project solar site and immediately\ndownstream are 0.5 feet, with velocities of less than 1 foot/second. Table 3.9-1 provides a breakdown of\nflow depths within the Project solar site. Four discharge points were evaluated for the flow depths and\nvelocities. Those points are shown in Figure 3.9-4 and Figure 3.9-6. Table 3.9-2 presents the results of the\nmodeling of flow volume and velocity changes as compared with the baseline conditions from the Project\nfor each discharge point. Overall changes for flow volumes and velocities would be a 3.3 and 5.5 percent\nincrease, respectively. Perimeter fencing is not anticipated to increase flooding risks or hazards. Impacts\nto flows and flooding is not anticipated from piling installation given the small size of each piling. Piles\nwould not likely be installed in drainages less than 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter, which are in most cases,\navoidable. MM WR-3 requires erosion control and bank stabilization devices to be installed in and around\non-site and off-site washes (subject to appropriate permits) if excessive scour or erosion is seen during\nconstruction or O&M. The measure also requires routine site inspections to identify and repair areas of\nerosion such as deep rills and gullies in the panel arrays and to maintain, change, or add additional erosion\ncontrol features if needed (in accordance with required permits).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.9-3** **Existing Conditions: Maximum Flow Depths in 6-Hour 100-Year Storm Event of**\n**the Proposed Solar Site**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.9-4** **Project: Maximum Flow Depths in 6-Hour 100-Year Storm Event of the Proposed**\n**Solar Site**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.9-5** **Existing Condition: Peak Velocities under the 6\u2013Hour 100-Year Storm Event of the**\n**Proposed Solar Site**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.9-6** **Project: Peak Velocities under the 6\u2013Hour 100-Year Storm Event of the Proposed**\n**Solar Site**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.9-1** **Flood Depth Onsite for the Proposed Action**\n\n\n\n\n|Peak flow depth (feet)|Percent of Project solar site covered by peak flow depths|\n|---|---|\n|0.00\u20130.49|89.9%|\n|0.50\u20131.00|4.9%|\n|1.01\u20131.50|1.8%|\n|1.51\u20132.00|1.0%|\n|2.01\u20132.50|0.7%|\n|2.51\u20133.00|0.6%|\n|3.01\u20134.00|0.8%|\n|4.01\u20136.00|0.3%|\n|6.01|0.0%|\n\n\nSource: (West Yost 2023)\n\n**Table 3.9-2** **Existing and Proposed Action Channel Volumes for the 6-Hour 100 Year Storm**\n**Event**\n\n\n\n\n\n|Discharge point|Existing channel volume (acre- feet)|Project volume (acre-feet)|Difference (cfs)|Increase (%) a|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|544|564|20|3.6|\n|2|129|148|20|13.3a|\n|3|24|32|8|24.1a|\n|4|1,139|1,167|28|2.4|\n|5|936|956|20|2.1|\n|Overall|2,771|2,867|96|3.3|\n\n\nNotes: [a] The percent increase for these discharge points shows a relatively large increase as the drainages\noriginate on the Project site.

Portions of Reese River Road, the Project\u2019s access road, are within a large wash and could be\naffected by flooding, which could result in washout of the road and could make travel unsafe during\nconstruction or O&M. MM WR-1 requires that the road be designed to minimize flood hazard risks.\nImprovements along Reese River Road would be made to the BLM road standards, and the road sections\nwould be engineered to reduce effects. The area most at risk is not expected to be USACOE jurisdictional\nand thus Section 404 and 401 permits are not anticipated to be necessary for this work.\n\nGen-tie poles would occupy a small surface area. They would not be expected to result in adverse changes\nin surface water flows that could cause off-site flooding and would not impact 100-year floodplains (West\nYost 2023). The gen-tie\u2019s access roads would be approximately 20 feet wide and covered with an\naggregate substrate where needed. Development of gen-tie access roads would result in approximately 64\nacres of vegetation removal but would largely follow land contours. Washes would cross over the gen-tie\naccess roads. To minimize adverse effects to incised drainages (thus, potential USACOE jurisdictional\nwater along the northern portion of the gen-tie) from direct fill, jurisdictional waters would be avoided\nduring gen-tie access road construction, per MM WR-3. Fill would only be allowed if unavoidable and\nwould require permitting through USACOE's Section 404 NWP program.\n\nSome minor alteration of flows could occur from changes in runoff patterns due to the access roads but\nwould be localized and away from any structures or infrastructure and thus adverse effects would not\noccur.\n\n**Groundwater.** A water right for Project construction and O&M would most likely be purchased (and\ntransferred to the place of use) and accessed through construction of an on-site groundwater well. A\nprimary pumping well location (PW-1) and an alternative well location (PW-A) were identified for the\nProject (Figure 3.9-7). The well would be designed to produce up to approximately 466 gallons per\nminute (1,000 acre-feet over the 16-month period) and then would provide up to 28 acre-feet per year for\nthe O&M phase of the Project. In order to assess whether groundwater level drawdown could occur from\nthe groundwater pumping on the Project site, a modeling effort was undertaken. The results of modeling\nshowed maximum groundwater drawdown of 5.83 feet within 2,000 feet of the well but 0.76 feet at 8,000\nfeet, as shown in Figure 3.9-7 and listed in Table 3.9-4.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.9-7** **Results of Groundwater Drawdown Analysis showing Maximum Drawdown**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.9-4** **Groundwater Drawdown Simulations Results**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Well|Distance downgradient of pumping well (feet/miles)|Drawdown after 16 months of construction, feet 1|Drawdown after 30 years of construction and O&M 2|Maximum drawdown (feet)|Elapsed time at maximum drawdown (years) 3|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|PW-1 (proposed well)|2,000/0.38|5.07|0.89|5.83|31.4|\n|PW-1 (proposed well)|4,000/0.76 mile|1.25|0.64|2.09|31.7|\n|PW-1 (proposed well)|8,000/1.5 mile|0.06|0.41|0.76|38.5|\n|PW-A (alternate well)|2,000 /0.38|2.53|0.44|2.92|31.4|\n|PW-A (alternate well)|4,000/0.76 mile|0.63|0.32|1.04|31.7|\n|PW-A (alternate well)|8,000/1.5 mile|0.03|0.21|0.38|38.5|\n\n\nNotes:\n1. Drawdown 16 months (1.3 years) after start of Project construction, prior to start of operations\npumping\n2. Drawdown 30 years after start of Project construction, prior to start of decommission pumping\n3. Years after the start of Project construction. Project pumping ended 31 years and 4 months (31.3 years)\nafter the start of Project construction.\n\nNo known wells that are currently in use and no known springs are located within 8,000 feet of the\nproposed pumping well site (or alternative site). Buckbrush Spring is the nearest spring to the Project\nsolar site and is located 3.6 miles (19,000 feet) southeast of PW-1. Most of the wells in the region are\nagricultural and industrial wells near East Walker River, approximately 5.5 to 8.5 miles northwest of the\nproposed pumping wells PW-A and PW-1, respectively. No measurable impact is anticipated to occur at\nsprings or existing water supply wells due to Project pumping. Western Solar Plan WR1-3 considers\nwater conservation measures related to solar energy technology water needs to reduce Project water\nrequirements and a Groundwater Monitoring and Reporting Plan would be implemented. Adverse effects\nto groundwater or groundwater uses would not occur.\n\nThe use of the well would require purchase of a water right with a change in Point of Diversion, Place of\nUse, and Manner of Use from the State Engineer and could potentially require the process for intercounty\ntransfers since the water would be used for dust control along the access road and gen-tie in Lyon County\n(while the well would be built in Mineral County). Refer to the Informational Summary of Water Rights,\nSupply, and Use for the Libra Solar Project (Panorama 2023) for more information on the process.\n\n\n-----\n\nAquifers are recharged by infiltration of precipitation to the subsurface. Increasing the acreage of\nimpervious surfaces in an area can adversely affect groundwater recharge by decreasing the amount of\nwater that infiltrates to the subsurface. New impervious surfaces resulting from Project construction would\ntotal an estimated 184 acres (including internal access roads, which, while not impervious, would be\ncompacted and, thus, semi-impervious). Areas of removed vegetation that could be compacted include an\nadditional 3,062 acres, comprising approximately 0.1 percent of the entire 287,360-acre Mason Valley\nGroundwater Basin. Rainwater is only 1 percent of the recharge. The Project is not expected to affect\ngroundwater infiltration in the basin.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nDecommissioning would include the removal of the solar facility and reclamation of the site, as described\nin a Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan. Erosion impacts, as well as impacts to water quality\nfrom accidental spill during demolition of the facility would be similar to those described for\nconstruction. The SWPPP and erosion control BMPs, Stormwater Quality Management Plan, Site\nDrainage Plan, as well as the SPCCP, would continue to apply. Any areas of vegetation removal and soil\ncompaction on the solar site as well as gen-tie alignment are not anticipated to recover for decades to a\ncentury or more. CRMP SOPs 4, 7, and 18 (Common to All) require rehabilitation and restoration of\ndisturbed areas to also minimize soil erosion (BLM 2001). The stormwater drainage volumes and flows\nwould be expected to continue to be similar to those for O&M. Impacts would not be adverse.\n\nGroundwater use for the Project O&M would cease although water may continue to be provided for\ngrazing. The modeling presented previously describes the impacts including decommissioning.\nGroundwater impacts would not be adverse as no other uses would be impacted and groundwater\ndrawdown would not affect any surrounding water uses.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nThe Proposed Action is not expected to cumulatively affect groundwater. If the Applicant acquires water\nrights in Mason Valley, the review and approval process to grant the Applicant use of existing water\nrights in the Mason Valley Hydrographic Unit would ensure that no adverse effects would result. No\nother projects are proposed that would utilize groundwater near the Project well (within a few thousand\nfeet) and, thus, compounded impacts of drawdown would not occur.\n\nNone of the other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects would affect the same drainage\nsystems as the Project, with the exception of Greenlink West. Greenlink West would be located upslope\nof the solar site and, thus, could contribute some minor increases in flow volumes and rates in drainages\nflowing onto the Project site. Given Greenlink West is a linear feature adjacent to an existing transmission\nline and would primarily utilize existing roads for the section of the alignment upslope of the solar site,\neffects would be minimal. A cumulative impact on stormwater flows and drainage increases would not\noccur. The water from the solar site flows in drainages that lose their bed and bank and converge west of\nthe solar site, south of the Nevada Copper Pumpkin Hollow Expansion Project area. The flows would\nneither impact the mine nor combine with drainage flows from the mine, which flow north. Adverse\ncumulative effects would not occur.\n\nNone of the cumulative projects would change flows that could impact the access road to the solar site\nand, thus, cumulative impacts are not anticipated for the access road. The gen-tie would run in close\nproximity to other potential solar projects, including Mason Valley Solar, Pine Nut Solar, Parker Butte\nSolar, and Sleepy Orange Solar. These projects are located near the northern portion of the gen-tie. The\ngen-tie is not expected to contribute to adverse changes in drainage, and these projects would likely\nrequire implementation of drainage control BMPs similar to the Project's; thus, adverse cumulative\nimpacts are not anticipated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.9.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\n**Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Decommissioning**\nImpacts from Alternative 1 for the access road and gen-tie on water quality and drainage/stormwater\nflows would be the same as for the Proposed Action and would require the same measures to be\nimplemented to reduce effects.\n\nConstruction impacts related to water quality and sedimentation from active construction activities at the\nsolar site would also be similar to those described for the Proposed Action but would be reduced since\nAlternative 1 would reduce ground disturbance based on the construction methods used that would\npreserve as much as 40 percent of vegetation within the solar array blocks. A SWPPP and erosion control\nBMPs, as well as an SPCCP, would be implemented to further reduce effects.\n\nThe changes in drainage systems from the construction and O&M of the Project from stormwater flows\nwere also modeled for this alternative to show the reduction in flow depths/volumes and velocities as\ncompared with the Proposed Action. Table 3.9-5 shows the stormwater flow volumes and velocities\nmodeled under existing conditions and Alternative 1. Figure 3.9-8 and Figure 3.9-9 depict the results. The\npeak volume during the 6-hour, 100-year storm event at the discharge points would reduce from a 3.3percent change for the Proposed Action over the baseline, to a 0.1-percent change over baseline\nconditions. The peak velocities during the 6-hour 100-year storm event would reduce from a 5.5-percent\nchange to a 0.5-percent change for Alternative 1, as compared to the Proposed Action. The changes in\ndrainage and potential for flooding would thus be very similar to existing conditions and not adverse\nunder this alternative.\n\n**Table 3.9-5** **Existing and Alternative 1 Maximum Channel Volumes for the 6-Hour 100 Year**\n**Storm Event**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Discharge point|Existing channel volume (acre- feet)|Proposed Action volume (acre- feet)|Difference (cfs)|Increase (%)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|544|547|3|0.6|\n|2|129|122|-6|-5.0|\n|3|24|28|4|13.3 a|\n|4|1,139|1,140|1|0.1|\n|5|936|938|1|0.1|\n|Overall|2,771|2,775|3|0.1|\n\n\nNotes: [a] The percent increase for these discharge points shows a relatively large percent increase as the\ndrainages originate on the Project site.

Adverse cumulative impacts are not anticipated.\n\n**_3.9.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nAlternative 2 would result in fewer vehicle trips on East Walker Road as compared to the Proposed\nAction but increased traffic on other routes used for supplemental access during construction. This\nalternative does not include any upgrades to the other access routes. Use of the supplemental access roads\nwould require additional dust control and maintenance; however, no new ground disturbance that could\nimpact water quality or create a new source of sedimentation would occur. All impacts, including for\nconstruction, O&M, and decommissioning, and cumulative impacts would be the same as described for\nthe Proposed Action. The same measures, including the SWPPP, BMPs, Western Solar Plan PDFs, and\nMMs, and management plans would apply to this alternative.\n\nGroundwater usage may be greater under this alternative as more roads would need dust control. The\namount is not expected to be substantial (i.e., <10 \u201315 percent) since reduced traffic on East Walker Road\nwould mean less dust control may be needed and that water would instead be used on the supplemental\naccess routes. The groundwater impacts were found to be very minor and, thus, minor increases in\ngroundwater use or needs are not anticipated to result in any impacts to groundwater uses. Impacts would\nnot be adverse.\n\n**_3.9.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\nUnder Alternative 3, impacts from the solar site and access road to water quality and flooding or drainage\nchanges during construction, O&M, and decommissioning would be the same as described for the\nProposed Action. The same measures, including the SWPPP, BMPs, Western Solar Plan PDFs, and MMs\nwould apply to this alternative. This alternative would reduce the potential impacts for runoff, spills, and\nminor changes in drainage by replacing the 24.1-mile-long gen-tie with a 0.54-mile-long gen-tie east of\nthe solar site to a switching station under the Greenlink West line. Impacts to the Mason Valley, including\nriparian areas around the Walker River and the WMA, would be avoided under this alternative. This\nalternative also reduces the Project\u2019s potential for impacts to jurisdictional waters associated with the\nWalker River. New areas of ground disturbance would occur that could impact drainage patterns;\nhowever, since the gen-tie and switching station would only impact 11.8 acres on areas of low slope,\nimpacts are not anticipated to be adverse. Less groundwater for dust suppression would be needed for this\nalternative since less ground disturbance is involved than for the Proposed Action. The same measures as\n\n\n-----\n\ndescribed for the Proposed Action would be applied to minimize effects, including implementation of an\nSWPPP, SPCCP, and Western Solar Plan PDFs, MMs, and management plans. Cumulative impacts\nwould also be similar to that described for the Proposed Action. By eliminating the gen-tie in the vicinity\nof the other potential solar projects, the Project under Alternative 3 would not contribute to drainage\nchanges associated with those projects. Cumulatively adverse impacts are not anticipated.\n\n**_3.9.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the Project would not be constructed, and no impacts to surface water,\ngroundwater, or jurisdictional waters would occur. Surface waters would continue to flow unobstructed,\nand no groundwater resources would be consumed. Water resources would not be affected.\n\n**_3.9.4.7 PDFs and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Project Design Features**\nProgrammatic design features from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix C. The Project would\ncomply with the following PDFs to minimize impacts to soils:\n\n-  WR1-1, 1-3\n\n-  SR2-1\n\n**The CRMP Measures**\nSOPs from the CRMP are listed in Appendix C. The following SOPs would minimize impacts to soils:\n\n-  Soils, Watershed, and Air SOPs 4, 7\n\n-  Common to All SOPs 10, 18\n\n**Plans Required and Mitigation Measures**\nPlans required include:\n\n-  Groundwater Monitoring and Reporting Plan\n\n-  Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan (Draft is available on the Project website)\n\n-  Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts on water\nresources, as well as MM Soils-1 from Section 3.4 Soils.\n\n**MM WR-1: Road Upgrades**\n\nThe Applicant, in coordination with Lyon County, shall ensure adequate road drainage and a maintenance\nplan for construction and O&M for East Walker Road to address any erosion before it can cause\nsedimentation or off-road impacts to the surrounding land and water, commensurate with the Project\u2019s use\nof the road. The Applicant shall also design all road upgrades to Reese River Road to the BLM Road\nStandards identified in the BLM Handbook 9113-1- Road Design. Reese River Road upgrades shall be\ndesigned to ensure safe passage at all times during storm events and shall be adequately maintained over\nthe life of the Project. Necessary permits shall be obtained based on the final design of the road\nimprovements.\n\n**MM WR-2: On-site Construction Water Ponds**\n\nOn-site ponds used for construction water shall be designed with appropriate freeboard and/or spillways\nand flow dissipation to ensure that water is held or properly discharged during a storm event without\ncausing excessive sedimentation.\n\n**MM WR-3: Bank Stabilization**\n\nDuring final Project design, the Applicant\u2019s engineer shall assess the need for erosion control and bank\nstabilization devices (including, if determined appropriate, riprap lining of wash banks to direct flows and\nprotect banks) to be installed in and around Project area washes and shall include recommended\n\n\n-----\n\nstabilization in the final design to be submitted to the BLM prior to issuance of the Notice to Proceed\n(NTP). The Applicant shall obtain appropriate permits as needed. The facility operator shall perform\nroutine site inspections to identify and repair areas of erosion, such as deep rills and gullies in the panel\narrays and along the gen-tie access routes, and shall maintain, change, or add additional erosion control\nfeatures if needed in accordance with required permits.\n\n**_3.9.4.8 Irreversible or Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nNo irreversible or irretrievable impacts to water resources would result from implementation of the\nProposed Action or alternatives. Surface waters impacted by the construction of access roads associated\nwith the Project could be restored to pre-construction conditions to the extent feasible following the 30year lifespan of the Project. Residual impacts are also not anticipated with mitigation.\n\n##### 3.10  Land Use, Realty, and Special Designations\n\n**3.10.1 Introduction**\nThis section is based on information provided in the Land Use and Corridor Report (Panorama 2023b).\n\n**3.10.2 Analysis Area**\nThe area of analysis for land use and realty features is the extent of lands that could be directly or\nindirectly affected by the Project, such as lands subject to an existing ROW, permit, lease, or easement; a\ndesignated transmission corridor; or another land use authorization. Direct or indirect effects on land use\nand realty would be limited to areas where land use designations or authorizations would change, where\npermanent features would be installed, or where land disturbance or land use conflicts could or would\noccur during construction.\n\n**3.10.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.10.3.1 Land Use and Realty_**\nThe Project solar site and proposed gen-tie are located almost entirely within BLM-administered land,\nwith the exception being approximately 2 miles of the 24.1-mile-long proposed gen-tie alignment that is\nlocated on State-owned lands within the Mason Valley WMA adjacent the Fort Churchill substation and\non private lands to the north of the Mason Valley WMA. The 13.8-mile-long access road is located within\nBLM-administered land except for a 2.1-mile segment that is located on non-BLM lands. Approximately\n18 miles of the gen-tie alignment that is located on BLM lands is within an existing designated Section\n368 energy corridor (DOE n.d.). The Fort Churchill substation is also the northern terminus of Greenlink\nWest, originating from Clark County, Nevada (Harry Allen substation).\n\nExisting, approved, and pending land use authorizations were identified in a title report for the Project,\nincluding lands affected as described in the public land survey system (PLSS) sections. The BLM\nprovided additional pending land use authorization information. All land use authorizations in and\nadjacent to the Project area are detailed in the Land Use and Corridor Report (Panorama 2023b) and\nsummarized in Table 3.10-1. Adjacent ROW holders were notified of the Project by the BLM. One ROW\nauthorization, serial number NVNV105887193 (legacy NVN 093397), for a distribution power line\ncrosses through the Project solar site. This distribution line is owned by NV Energy doing business as\nSierra Pacific Power, and the ROW was renewed in 2021; however, it is not currently energized. The\nProject includes realignment of this distribution line through the solar site, as shown in Figure 3.10-1.\nSeveral other existing ROWs cross the gen-tie alignment, including the following:\n\n-  NVN1060796522 (legacy N-1018): LADWP Pacific DC Transmission Line\n\n-  NVNV106083279 (legacy N-60243): Union Pacific Railroad\n\n-  NVNV106143630 (legacy N-40975): Lyon County Pete Hendrich\u2019s Road\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.10-1 ROW Authorization NVNV105887193 through the Proposed Project Solar Site**\n\nSource: (Westwood 2022)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.10-1 Land Use Authorizations in the Project Area**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Name|Type of ROW authorization|Status|Owner/applicant|BLM Case file number|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Greenlink West|Power transmission infrastructure (525 kV transmission line)|Proposed|NV Energy|N-099863|\n|Mason Valley East Solar|400 MW solar facility|Proposed|NextEra|N-100105|\n|Pine Nut Solar|200 MW solar facility|Proposed|NextEra|N-100106|\n|Sleepy Orange|500 MW solar facility|Proposed|Sleepy Orange Solar, LLC|N-101056|\n|Honey Mesquite|500 MW solar facility|Proposed|Honey Mesquite Solar, LLC|N-101526|\n|Nettleleaf|500 MW solar facility|Proposed|Nettleleaf Solar, LLC|N-101524|\n|U.S. Route 95 Alternate (US 95A)|Transportation (Interstate highway)|Operating|Nevada Department of Transportation|N-091950|\n|Old State Road 2C|Transportation (Roadway)|Decommissioned|N/A|N/A|\n|Southern Pacific (Union Pacific) Railroad|Transportation (Railroad)|Operating|Union Pacific|NVNV106083279 (legacy N-60243)|\n|Reese River Road|Transportation (Roadway)|Operating|Lyon County|N/A|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co|N-091646|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co|N-00725|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Company/NV Energy|Distribution|Not operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co.|NVNV105887193 (legacy NVN- 093397)|\n|LADWP Pacific DC Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Los Angeles Department of Water and Power|NVN1060796522 (legacy N-1018)|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Name|Type of ROW authorization|Status|Owner/applicant|BLM Case file number|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Wassuk Microwave Station|Transmission|Relinquished|American Tower LP|N-73815|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Company Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co.|N-94367|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Company Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co.|N-91233|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Company Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co.|N-91655|\n|Miller Dusty LLC Geothermal|Geothermal Lease|Closed|Miller Dusty LLC|N-79706|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Company Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co.|N-005253|\n|John David Stanley|Road|Operating|John David Stanley|N-041273|\n|NDOT Highway|Federal-aid highway|Operating|NDOT|N-61187|\n|Lyon County Pete Hendrich\u2019s Road|Road|Operating|Lyon County|NVNV106143630 (legacy N-40975)|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Company Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co.|N-43296|\n|Michael A Sturge Irrigation Well|Water facility: well|Operating|Michael and Michelle Sturge|N-78533|\n|LA Department of Water and Power Communication Site|Communication site|Operating|LA Department of Water and Power|N-1117|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Name|Type of ROW authorization|Status|Owner/applicant|BLM Case file number|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Company Transmission Line|Transmission|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co.|N-7255|\n|Sierra Pacific Power Company Transmission Line|Distribution infrastructure (12.5 kV)|Operating|Sierra Pacific Power Co.|N-91645|\n\n\n**_3.10.3.2 Transportation Corridors_**\nRegional site access is provided by US 95A, which bisects the gen-tie alignment east\u2013west and then runs\nnorth\u2013south on the west side of the Mason Valley, opposite the gen-tie. Where the gen-tie and US 95A\ncross, the gen-tie alignment is within the existing Section 368 energy corridor (corridor 18-224). US 95A\nprovides connection to Yerington, Nevada, via US 95 and US 50. SR 208 would be used for access to the\nsolar site, connecting to unpaved East Walker Road and Reese River Road. Lyon County maintains East\nWalker Road (Lyon County 2006). The BLM maintains Reese River Road. Union Pacific (UP) operates\nthe Hawthorne Branch rail line, which connects to a UP mainline east of Fallon, Nevada. The UP\nmainline passes near the Fort Churchill substation.\n\n**_3.10.3.3 Utility Corridors_**\nTwo designated utility corridors are in the Project area, including the BLM\u2019s utility corridors and the\nSection 368 energy corridor (as shown in Figure 3.10-2). The BLM\u2019s utility corridors are located\nimmediately adjacent to both the eastern and western borders of the Project solar site. The corridors\nconverge, continuing north along the proposed gen-tie alignment, crossing through the Fort Churchill\nsubstation.\n\nThe Section 368 energy corridor serves as a multi-jurisdictional interstate pathway. The Section 368\nenergy corridor follows a nearly identical route to the BLM\u2019s utility corridors on the eastern and western\nborders of the Project solar site. The Section 368 energy corridor is approximately 2 miles wide and\ncontinues north along an existing BLM utility corridor. Included within the utility corridors is Los\nAngeles Department of Water and Power\u2019s (LADWP's) Pacific DC Transmission Line (BLM Case file\nnumber NVN1060796522 [legacy N-1018]) that runs parallel for an approximate 5-mile portion of the\ngen-tie alignment and then crosses near the northern end of the gen-tie alignment.\n\n**_3.10.3.4 Specially Designated Areas_**\n\n**National Conservation Areas**\nThe Pistone-Black Mountain NCA was designated by Congress and signed into law in December 2022.\nThe area includes 3,415 acres to be managed by the BLM, as shown in Figure 3.10-3. The site has\ncultural and historical significance to the Walker River Paiute Tribe and is used for pine nut picking,\nceremonies, and visiting sacred sites (Walker River Paiute Tribe 2019). The site includes significant\narchaeological resources as well as petroglyphs. It is located within 5 miles of the Project solar site;\nhowever, it is not easily accessible from the Project solar site due to rugged intervening terrain.\n\n**National Historic Trails**\nThe California National Historic Trail is located approximately 9.4 west of the Project solar site. The\nPony Express National Historic Trail is located approximately 26 miles north of the Project solar site and\napproximately 9 miles north of the northern-most portion of the gen-tie. These trails are shown in Figure\n3.10-3.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.10-2 Utility Corridors**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.10-3 Special Management Areas**\n\n\n-----\n\n**State Parks and Wildlife Management Areas**\nThe State-managed Pitchfork Ranch section of the Walker River State Recreation Area is located\napproximately 3.5 miles east of the Project area along East Walker Road (as shown in Figure 3.10-3). The\nProject access road along Reese River Road provides access to and is partially located on the Walker\nRiver State Recreation Area.\n\nThe Mason Valley WMA is located north of Yerington, Nevada, and is nearly surrounding the Fort\nChurchill substation. The proposed gen-tie alignment borders the WMA to the east and south. The\nproposed gen-tie alignment crosses a small portion of the most northern section of the Mason Valley\nWMA. No other WMAs are located within or near the Project area (including the Project solar site, gentie, and access road).\n\nGas transmission lines are located on the northwest side of the Mason Valley, north of Yerington and\nextending northwest from the Fort Churchill substation, following the BLM utility corridor (DOT 2023).\n\n**American Indian Reservations**\nThe Walker River Reservation (Reservation), belonging to the Walker River Paiute Tribe, is located to\nthe northeast of the Project area. The Project solar site is on the west side of the Wassuk Mountain Range,\nopposite the Reservation. The linear distance between the Reservation and Project solar site varies;\nhowever, it is bisected by the Wassuk Range until the northern end of the proposed gen-tie alignment (as\nshown in Figure 3.10-3). The Project solar site or other components are not proposed to be sited on any\nReservation lands.\n\n**_3.10.3.5 Military and Civilian Aviation_**\nThe Project is not within the area of Risk of Adverse Impact on Military Operations and Readiness Areas\n(RAIMORA). The closest RAIMORA site is the Restricted Airspace R2508 and Nevada Test and\nTraining Range (NTTR) near the Hawthorne Army Depot and associated facilities (DOD 2016). The\nProject and surrounding area is within multiple military training routes. Figure 3.10-5 shows military\ntraining routes, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) special use airspace, and military airbases and\ntraining targets. There are 21 registered airports (including airfields) within 50 miles of the Project area.\nThe closest registered airports include Yerington Municipal and the Lantana Ranch, a private airport\nlocated 14 miles southeast of Yerington. Figure 3.10-4 shows the locations of airports within 50 miles of\nthe Project solar area, which is inclusive of the gen-tie.\n\nThe BLM and other federal or State agencies conduct low-level flights in the Project vicinity for fire\noperations, wild horse and burro censuses and gathers, wildlife inventories, facility maintenance, or other\nactivities. Aerial operations for resource management activities are not known to occur in the immediate\nProject area, nor are any aerial training activities. In the event of a wildland fire in the area, it is assumed\nthat aerial firefighting operations could occur in the Project area below an altitude of 500 feet above\nground level for the deployment of smokejumper crews, water and fire retardants, and miscellaneous\npara-cargo (BLM and DOE 2012).\n\n**_3.10.3.6 Mineral Resources_**\nThe closest active mine to the Project solar site is the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine, owned by Nevada\nCopper. Pumpkin Hollow is located on private land that was withdrawn from public land in 2015 through\nan act of Congress. The Project gen-tie alignment crosses through unpatented mining claim areas. The\nclosest mining claim areas for Pumpkin Hollow are approximately 0.3 mile to the northwest of the Project\nsolar site, as shown in Figure 3.10-6. The gen-tie alignment traverses seven sections that have active or\nfiled claims within them. These claims are related to Pumpkin Hollow (as shown in Figure 3.10-6). The\nsections and number of claims crossing the gen-tie alignment are listed in Table 3.10-2.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.10-4 Airports**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.10-5 Military Routes**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.10-6 Mining Claims**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.10-2** **Active Claims within Gen-Tie Alignment**\n\n|Township|Range|Section|Number of claims|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|12 North|27 East|5|8|\n|13 North|27 East|17|3|\n|13 North|27 East|20|33|\n|13 North|27 East|21|36|\n|13 North|27 East|28|45|\n|13 North|27 East|29|27|\n|13 North|27 East|32|20|\n\n\n\nSource: (EnviroMine, Inc. 2022)\n\n**3.10.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.10.4.1 Methods_**\nExisting land use data were collected through analysis of aerial photography, field verification, review of\nexisting studies and plans and BLM databases, and through coordination with local and county agencies.\nThe Project was reviewed for conflicts with applicable land uses and realty, plans and policies, special\nmanagement areas, and military and civilian aviation.\n\n**_3.10.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Land Use and Realty.** Several existing approved and pending land use authorizations are found in the\nProject area, as shown in Table 3.10-1. The Project could impact existing and approved, as well as\nproposed, new land use authorizations if it conflicts with activities authorized in the ROW or lease. The\nApplicant would be required to coordinate with existing ROW holders where the Project would be located\nadjacent to or crossing an existing ROW. Any work within an existing ROW would be coordinated with\nthe existing ROW holder.\n\nA distribution line ROW held by Sierra Pacific Power Company (doing business as NV Energy) is\nlocated within the Project solar site (NVNV105887193) and would need to be re-routed through\ncoordination with NV Energy and a permitting process with NV Energy. This line is not energized;\nhowever, NV Energy renewed the ROW in August of 2021 for 30 years. The Project gen-tie alignment\nwould cross several existing and proposed transmission line ROWs, including the existing LADWP\nPacific DC Transmission Line (NVN1060796522 [legacy N-1018]), which may require a License\nAgreement that would be submitted to LADWP prior to construction. The gen-tie would also parallel the\nproposed Greenlink West ROW (N-099863) for approximately 20 miles.\n\nCoordination would be needed to ensure that, when the final engineering and design is completed for the\nproposed Project and Greenlink West, the placement of the line and ROW are compatible, including\nclearance distances. Several other transmission and gas lines are located in proximity to the Fort Churchill\nsubstation and would require additional coordination during the Project\u2019s final design to avoid conflicts.\n\nThe Western Solar Plan PDF LR2-1 requires that solar facilities be designed and constructed to avoid,\nminimize, and/or mitigate impacts on the BLM land use planning designations. Additionally, Solar PDF\nLR1-1 requires that land use conflicts and constraints be identified in the WEAP. The WEAP would be\nprovided to all personnel prior to entering the Project site. MM LU-1 would be implemented to avoid\npotential ROW conflicts during construction. MM LU-1 requires coordination with the transmission line\nholders (i.e., NV Energy and LADWP) to identify potential conflicts between existing and proposed\ntransmission lines and Project gen-tie lines. Additional requirements include reaching an agreement with\n\n\n-----\n\nNV Energy for relocation of the existing distribution line through the Project solar site and adjustments to\nthe ROW for the distribution line and scheduling with the appropriate holder (i.e., NV Energy) in\noverlapping ROW areas to minimize disruption to construction activities. Potential impacts to ROW\nwould be minimized through the implementation of MM LU-1.\n\n**Transportation Corridors.** Improvements to the unpaved East Walker Road, Reese River Road, and Old\nState Road 2C would be required to sustain heavy truck traffic for construction. Preliminary estimates\ninclude improving the road base and some stabilization where required. The Project is anticipated to have\na long-term beneficial impact on these transportation corridors and improve public access while reducing\ndust generation. East Walker Road would be paved and is managed by Lyon County Roads. To ensure no\nconflicts, the Applicant would need to obtain the appropriate permits for use and upgrade of roadways\nunder county and State jurisdiction.\n\nThe Project would temporarily impact transportation corridors where the gen-tie lines would cross local\nroads as well as US 95A and the UP Railroad. Transportation routes in the Project area would see an\nincrease in vehicle traffic during implementation of the Project, especially during construction activities\n). Project construction activities would occur over a 16month period and would not block or preclude existing land use authorizations located within or adjacent (see Section _3.17: Transportation and Traffic_\nto the analysis area. Traffic concerns would be addressed within the Traffic and Transportation Plan and\nwould not cause an impact to adjacent landowners, land uses, or transportation routes to adjacent land.\n\nSupport structures for the gen-tie lines would be installed outside of the transportation corridors. The\nstructures and suspended conductor would not impede travel; however, brief highway, road, and railway\nclosures are expected during construction (installation) and decommissioning (removal) of the overhead\nconductor. Closures are necessary for safety purposes when installing/removing temporary guard\nstructures and during specific periods of the conductor stringing process.\n\nTemporary closure of US 95A, local roads, and the railroad would be coordinated with NDOT, Lyon\nCounty, and UP Railroad, respectively. The necessary encroachment permits and authorizations would be\nobtained prior to any work within the ROWs. Vehicle traffic on highways would be managed according\nto NDOT encroachment permit requirements. Adverse impacts to existing transportation corridors are not\nanticipated as the Applicant would be required to obtain the appropriate permissions, approvals, and\npermits to cross the transportation corridors.\n\n**Utility Corridors.** The Project is designed to avoid conflicts with utilities that would be crossed by or\naligned parallel to the gen-tie line. The Project would be built within the existing Section 368 energy\ncorridor as an authorized use of the corridor. The Project solar site was selected to avoid the energy\ncorridors to the east and west as well as the north. No incompatible uses with energy corridors would\noccur. The gen-tie would be located outside of energy corridors, including just to the north of the solar\nsite, in order to avoid designated Bi-State sage grouse habitat within the energy corridor. The gen-tie\nwould also be constructed outside the BLM utility corridor as the corridor crosses through the Mason\nValley WMA, which contains sensitive resources. No adverse effects on energy corridors would occur.\n\n**Specially Designated Areas.** _Overview._ Specially designated areas identified within 25 miles of the\nProject area include both boundary-based features (e.g., parks and conservation areas) and linear features\n(i.e., national trails and byways). All specially designated areas are sufficiently removed from the Project\narea to avoid direct impacts or adverse land use effects.\n\n_National Conservation Areas._ The Project solar site would be located approximately 2.5 miles from the\n3,415-acre Pistone-Black Mountain NCA. A visual analysis was completed to review potential visual\nimpacts to the NCA (BLM and DOE 2012). The visual analysis concluded that the surrounding\ntopography would screen the majority of the Project from view and that, at positions from which it is\nvisible, the Project solar site would not dominate the natural characteristics of the viewshed. Due to the\nlack of visibility and the distance to the Project area from key viewpoints, no impacts to the NCA are\nanticipated from the Project solar site. Refer to Section _3.13: Visual Resources_ for more information on\nthe visual analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe proposed gen-tie would be a high voltage line, which can generate corona noise, particularly in wet\nconditions and high heat. Corona noise is a buzzing sound that can be up to 50 to 60 decibels at 50 feet.\nNoise drops off approximately 6 decibels per doubling of distance and at 2.5 miles would be expected to\nbe imperceptible within the Pistone-Black Mountain NCA. Background noise levels in a rural, quiet\nenvironment are around 45 decibels. Due to the distance between the Project and Black Mountain, no\nadverse effects are anticipated.\n\n_National Trails._ The Project solar site and other components may be visible from the California National\nHistoric Trail just south of Yerington, Nevada. However, views of the gen-tie structures would be\nobscured by topography. During clear atmospheric conditions, the solar panels may be slightly visible in\nthe distant background but would not draw the attention of the casual viewer due to the presence of the\ncity of Yerington located between the trail and the Project solar site in the distant background (Panorama\n2023a). Refer to Section _3.13: Visual Resources_ for more information on the visual analysis.\n\nThe Project would not be visible from the Pony Express National Historic Trail due to distance\n(approximately 26 miles) from the Project solar site. The northernmost portion of the proposed gen-tie\nalignment is approximately 9 miles from the Pony Express Trail but would be located near existing\ntransmission and energy facilities associated with the Fort Churchill Generating Station and the Fort\nChurchill substation. Other facilities, including the Wabuska geothermal plant, are found between the\nPony Express Trail and the gen-tie alignment, as is a mountain range. Given the intervening topography,\nthe gen-tie would not have visual impacts on the corridor of the trail (Panorama 2023a). The Project\nwould not affect the scenic quality and historical significance of the National Trails; therefore, no impacts\nto National Trails are anticipated.\n\n_State Parks and Wildlife Management Areas._ The Pitchfork Ranch section of the Walker River State\nRecreation Area borders East Walker Road, which serves as an access route to the Project. Heavy truck\ntraffic would increase during construction and decommissioning. Dust control would be implemented\nalong East Walker Road during these times to reduce potential impacts to air quality and safety. Road\nclosures along East Walker Road are not proposed during any phase of the Project. Temporary delays or\nincreased travel times due to construction traffic may occur but would not be significant as roads would\nremain open throughout construction, O&M, and decommissioning phases. Long-term operational traffic\nwould not be expected to be noticeable above current volumes. The Applicant would work with Lyon and\nMineral counties in development of a Traffic and Transportation Plan that would address traffic related\nissues.\n\nOn-site reconnaissance was performed for potential visual impacts from the Walker River State\nRecreation Area Park entrance, looking east toward the Project solar site. It was determined that the\nnatural topography would obscure potential views of any Project components, and the viewpoint (i.e., key\nobservation point, or KOP) was not carried forward for further technical analysis (Panorama 2023a).\nRefer to Section _3.13: Visual Resources_ for more information on the visual analysis.\n\nLess than 1,000 feet of the proposed gen-tie alignment would cross the Mason Valley WMA. Although\nthe added overhead transmission infrastructure would be visible from points within the WMA, it would\nbe similar to the existing infrastructure related to the Fort Churchill Generating Station. During\nconstruction of the gen-tie, potential ground disturbance would comprise less than 1 acre. No new roads\nwould be constructed within the WMA. Existing access roads within the WMA would be used to access\nthe gen-tie. The Applicant would work with NDOW to obtain the appropriate rights from the Nevada\nDivision of State Lands to construct in the WMA on NDOW property.\n\nThe Applicant would coordinate with NDOW to avoid and/or minimize any adverse direct effects. The\nProject would not alter any intrinsic value or use within any state parks or lands. With implementation of\na collaboratively developed Traffic and Transportation Plan to address traffic volumes and use of dust\nsuppression, impacts during construction and decommissioning to the State parks and lands would be\nminor. No long-term impacts would be expected.\n\n_American Indian Reservations._ Although no Project components are proposed within Reservation\nboundaries, a section of the proposed gen-tie alignment, at its point farthest northeast, is in close\n\n\n-----\n\nproximity to the Reservation lands. MM LU-2 would be implemented to realign that section of the gen-tie\nto ensure it is compatible with Greenlink West and to ensure no portion of the ROW is on the Walker\nRiver Reservation (unless otherwise agreed upon). Potential impacts to American Indian reservations\nwould be avoided through implementation of MM LU-2.\n\n**Military and Civilian Aviation.** _Air Space._ The tallest components within the Project solar site would be\npoles for the collector lines, which would not exceed 50 feet above ground level (AGL). The proposed\ngen-tie structure heights may range from 100 feet to just over 200 feet. FAA evaluation for safety hazards\npursuant to Title 49 USC. section 44718 would be required since gen-tie components could exceed\n200 feet AGL. The expected outcome may include the need for lighting at the top of the facilities.\n\nMM LU-3 requires the Applicant to coordinate with FAA for the airspace evaluation process and to\nimplement the required measures to avoid hazards to airspace. Adverse impacts would be avoided\nthrough the appropriate coordination and planning requirements and implementation of the requirements\nidentified by the FAA.\n\n_Aviation Emergencies and Dangers from Glint and Glare_ **.** PV panels installed for the Project would\nreflect a greater amount of specular light than the existing desert landscape; however, the amount of\nreflected light would not reach levels that would create an aviation hazard. Adverse effects are not\nanticipated. Refer to Section: _3.13 Visual Resources_ for more information on visual impacts.\n\n_Communication System Interference._ Project components would not be installed near aviation\ncommunication antennas or block transmission signals. Adverse effects are not anticipated.\n\n**Mineral Resources.** Continued operation of existing mines outside of the Project area would not be\nimpacted by construction or O&M of the Project. The Project includes the temporary withdrawal of 5,141\nacres of land from mineral entry (i.e., mining claims cannot be staked under mining law) for a 2-year\nperiod from the release of the NOI in April 2023. Should the Project be authorized, the Project solar site\nwould not be available for new mineral entry for the duration of the solar ROW. This withdrawal would\nlimit access to mineral resources if they were to occur under the solar site; however, the withdrawal is\nallowed under FLPMA multiple-use mandates. Adverse effects would not be expected given no active\nmineral claims are found within the Project solar site. Mineral resources occur across the Project region in\nareas that are not affected by the Project.\n\nThe gen-tie would have a limited footprint and is not expected to impact claims along its route.\nAdditionally, the majority of the gen-tie alignment is within designated utility corridors. Saleable\nminerals (e.g., sand, gravel), if encountered during construction, would be used on site. The quantity of\nexcess saleable mineral materials and soil resources that could be removed from the Project area during\nconstruction would not be substantial compared to the overall quantity that would remain and be available\nfollowing decommissioning. No significant adverse direct effects on the availability of mineral resources\nor mineral extraction would occur.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\nO&M impacts on land use and realty would be limited to the potential for conflict with existing land use\nprograms, plans, policies, or authorizations. The Project would preclude the development of other land\nuses on the solar site but does not conflict with the BLM\u2019s existing solar energy project policies (BLM\nand DOE 2012) nor would it conflict with any existing land uses in the Project area.\n\nLong-term operation of the Project would remain in conformance with the existing federal, State, and\nlocal land use plans and policies for land use and energy corridors. Implementation of the Project would\nnot conflict with existing BLM land use authorizations. No new impacts to land use or realty would occur\nbeyond those discussed under Construction Impacts.\n\nAs with the construction, Project O&M would not result in impacts to air space, aviation emergency, and\nglint and glare, nor would it interfere with communication systems. Adverse effects are not anticipated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nLand use and realty impacts associated with decommissioning and reclamation activities for the Project\nwould be similar to those associated with construction. Transportation routes in the region would see an\nincrease in vehicle traffic during Project decommissioning activities (refer to Section _3.17 Traffic and_\n_Transportation_ ). Traffic and transportation impacts from the Project decommissioning are anticipated to\nbe less than those experienced during construction and would be addressed within a separate Traffic and\nTransportation Plan for decommissioning. Decommissioning of the Project would occur in conformance\nwith Project reclamation plans, which would be reviewed by the BLM and required to include any new or\nrevised land use policies. Decommissioning activities are therefore not anticipated to result in impacts to\nsurrounding land use and realty.\n\nDecommissioning activities would not adversely affect mineral resources. Once decommissioning is\ncompleted and the ROW terminated, the surface would be available for surface extraction of mineral\nresources again. No direct effects on the availability of mineral resources or mineral extraction would\noccur during decommissioning.\n\nFollowing Project decommissioning and reclamation activities, lands associated with the Project would be\nreclaimed and returned to their pre-Project state to the extent feasible. Lands associated with the Project\nwould remain under the management of the BLM and would be available for use in accordance with the\nBLM\u2019s multiple-use mandate. No long-term impacts to land use and realty from decommissioning\nactivities would result.\n\n**_3.10.4.3 Cumulative Impacts_**\nPotential cumulative impacts on land use and realty could occur during Project construction, its\nanticipated 30-year lifespan, and during decommissioning. Other proposed solar developments in the\nMason Valley and in Mineral County still need to undergo environmental review and permitting and\nwould require coordination with existing ROW holders and consideration of existing land uses, prior to\nauthorization or construction. This would reduce any cumulative effects to land use and realty. While\ncumulative adverse land use effect would be minimized, the build-out of the Mason Valley and other\nareas of Mineral County would result in a moderate loss to other potential land uses over the life of the\nprojects. The cumulative build-out of the Mason Valley and the Highway 95 corridor in Mineral County\nwith solar and mining development would not change the land uses for existing special management areas\nbut would alter the overall cumulative existing conditions in these areas due to visual effects, as discussed\nin Section _3.13: Visual Resources_ , and change in recreational setting, as discussed in Section _3.12:_\n_Recreation_ .\n\n**_3.10.4.4 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nUnder Alternative 1, Project construction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts related to\neffects on existing land use and realty, effects on special management areas, and effects on aviation would\nremain the same as the Proposed Action because the Project components and total acres of disturbance\nwould be only 9 acres less than for the Proposed Action. The same MMs, including MM LU-1, MM LU2, and MM LU-3 would apply to this alternative to reduce any adverse effects.\n\n**_3.10.4.5 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nUnder Alternative 2, Project construction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts related to\neffects on existing land use and realty, effects on special management areas, and effects on aviation would\nremain the same under Alternative 2 as the Proposed Action. The solar site, access road, and gen-tie\nwould be constructed as described for the Proposed Action.\n\nThis alternative includes providing supplemental access to the solar site during construction. The access\nwould need to be coordinated with existing land ownerships (e.g., Nevada Copper) and ROW holders\n(e.g., LADWP) and agreements established prior to authorizing supplemental access uses to ensure no\nconflicts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.10.4.6 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-Tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\n\n**Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Decommissioning**\nImpacts would be the same as for the Proposed Action for the solar site and access road since the\nconstruction, O&M, and decommissioning phases would be the same as for the Proposed Action. The\n24.1-mile-long gen-tie would be reduced to a 0.54-mile-long gen-tie and switching station under the\nGreenlink West line. The switching station would impact the proposed ROW for Greenlink West and\nwould thus need to be approved by NV Energy in order to implement this alternative. Overall, this\nalternative would eliminate one of two 525 kV lines up to Fort Churchill substation and would thus not\nresult in conflicts with any other ROWs in the vicinity of the Fort Churchill substation, nor along the gentie. The Project would not need to cross US 95A or the UP Railroad. MM LU-1 would still apply, except\nthat the coordination with LADWP and other transmission line ROWs would not be needed. MM LU-2\nwould not apply since the gen-tie would no longer cross near Reservation lands. MM LU-3 would still\napply for the limited number of gen-tie poles needed to connect the solar site to the new switching station.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nThe solar site acreage would be the same for Alternative 3 as the Proposed Action and would contribute\nto the overall increase in utility-scale solar development within the Mason Valley and Mineral County.\nCumulative impacts related to Alternative 3 would be similar yet reduced as compared to the Proposed\nAction because there would be no impacts related to the 24.1-mile gen-tie line.\n\n**_3.10.4.7 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the BLM would not authorize a ROW grant, and the Proposed Action\nwould not be implemented. The public lands in the Project area would continue to be managed by the\nBLM in accordance with existing land use designations, which may include the construction and\noperation of a different solar project or other energy development. There would be no use of the land area\nor designated utility corridors and, therefore, no contribution to cumulative land use impacts.\n\n**_3.10.4.8 Relevant Required PDFs, the CRMP Standard Operating Procedures,_**\n**_Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan PDFs**\nProgrammatic design features (PDFs) from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project\nwould comply with the following PDFs to minimize impacts to land uses:\n\n-  LR1-1 and LR2-1\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nNo SOPs from the CRMP are directly applicable to the impact analysis.\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans, required by the BLM ROW grant, would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction to minimize impacts to land use and realty:\n\n-  Worker Environmental and Awareness Program\n\n-  Traffic Management Plan\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts on land\nuse and realty:\n\n**LU-1: ROW Coordination**\n\nThe following measures would be undertaken to avoid ROW conflicts:\n\n-  Coordination would occur with transmission line ROW holders/applicants to identify potential\nconflicts between existing and proposed transmission lines and Project gen-tie lines.\n\n\n-----\n\n-  Coordination with NV Energy would occur to reach an agreement for realignment of the existing\ndistribution line through the Project solar site and adjustments to the ROW for the distribution line.\n\n-  Facility adjustments would be incorporated into final design and engineering plans through\ncooperative engineering agreements with LADWP and NV Energy, as needed, to avoid any\nconflicts, such as adjusting the locations or heights of conductors and support structures, including\ntowers, or by evaluating other means of the Project\u2019s gen-tie lines crossing existing transmission\nline ROWs.\n\n-  Construction activities would be scheduled with the appropriate ROW holder/applicant (e.g.,\nNV Energy) in overlapping ROW areas to minimize disruption to construction activities.\n\n**LU-2: Avoidance of Reservation Land**\n\nThe final design of the Project gen-tie shall be subject to micro-adjustments to the alignment to ensure\nthat the ROW of the gen-tie alignment does not cross onto Reservation Lands while ensuring avoidance\nor minimization of cultural or biological resources from realignment.\n\n**LU-3: FAA and DoD Compliance**\n\nThe Applicant shall apply for the appropriate approvals and clearances under Title 49 USC\n[section 44718](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2011-title49/USCODE-2011-title49-subtitleVII-partA-subpartiii-chap447-sec44718) for the FAA and Part 211 of Title 32 CFR for the DoD and shall provide documentation of\napprovals and clearances to the BLM prior to construction.\n\n**_3.10.4.9 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nNo irreversible commitments of resources would occur because the Project site would be reclaimed after\ndecommissioning of the Project, and these uses could then be reestablished. No residual effects on land\nauthorizations or transportation corridors would occur as coordination, obtaining permissions and\nauthorizations, and implementing design modifications would avoid conflicts. The Project would not\nresult in residual effects to utility corridors or military and civilian aviation as all impacts would be\nminimized once mitigation is implemented.\n\n##### 3.11 Rangeland Resources\n\n**3.11.1 Introduction**\nThis section summarizes information provided in the Land Use and Corridor Report, Chapter 4:\nRangeland Resources (Panorama 2023). The BLM lands within the Project area are available to graze\nunder the current land use plan and are within actively permitted grazing allotments. Grazing on public\nlands is authorized by the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Management of grazing lands is also governed by\nFLPMA and the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. The number of livestock authorized per\ngrazing allotment on public land is measured using animal unit months (AUM), which is the amount of\nforage needed to sustain one cow and calf, one horse, or five sheep or goats for one month. The BLM\nmanages grazing so that the land can attain and maintain the desired condition defined by rangeland\nhealth standards and guidelines.\n\n**3.11.2 Analysis Area**\nThe area of analysis for rangeland resources is the extent of land that could be directly or indirectly\naffected by the Project. Direct effects would be limited to designated rangeland that could be disturbed or\nconverted to incompatible uses. Potential indirect effects on rangeland resources would be limited to a\nfew miles or less or to locations where existing grazing activities in the Project area could be diverted due\nto a loss in grazing land (i.e., other public lands in the vicinity where grazing is allowed).\n\n**3.11.3 Affected Environment**\nThe Project (including the solar site, gen-tie, and access road) would intersect five grazing allotments\nmanaged by BLM: Gray Hills, Perry Springs-Deadman, Black Mountain, Parker Butte, and Cleaver Peak\n\n\n-----\n\n(as shown in Figure 3.11-1, and Table 3.11-1). More details on the grazing allotments are included in the\nLand Use and Corridor Report for the Project (Panorama 2023). The proposed gen-tie line alignment\nROW would bisect the Black Mountain, Parker Butte, and Cleaver Peak allotments. The Gray Hills and\nPerry Deadman Springs allotments overlap with the proposed Project solar site (as shown in Figure\n3.11-1).\n\nThe Gray Hills and Perry Springs-Deadman allotments overlap with the proposed Project solar site by\napproximately 1,722 and 3,419 acres, respectively (as shown in Figure 3.11-1). The Talbott Livestock\nCompany LLC currently holds the grazing preferences for the Gray Hills and Perry Springs-Deadman\nallotments. The Rafter 7 Ranch serves as the base property associated with the permit and was donated to\nthe State of Nevada and is now part of the Walker River State Recreation Area. The Walker Basin\nConservancy manages the ranch on behalf of the State as the base property associated with the permit.\n\nAssociated grazing infrastructure, also commonly called _range improvements_ , within or near the proposed\nProject solar site include fencing, a cattleguard, surface water spring water sources, well water sources,\nmultiple water pipelines, water troughs, water storage tanks, and corrals (as shown in Figure 3.11-2 and\nFigure 3.11-3). Access to these allotments and the infrastructure for both allotments is primarily by Reese\nRiver Road.\n\n**Table 3.11-1 Open Grazing Allotments within the Project Area**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Allotment name (BLM allotment number)|BLM field office|Management status|Use|Total active AUMs|Total acres|Proximity|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Gray Hills (NV-03539)|Stillwater|Maintain|Active|4,751|105,451|Overlaps 1,722 acres of the Project solar site|\n|Perry Springs- Deadman (NV-03573)|Stillwater|Maintain|Active|2,933|62,830|Overlaps 3,419 acres of the Project solar site and gen-tie alignment|\n|Black Mountain (NV-03507)|Stillwater|Custodial|Active|900|14,320|Gen-tie alignment|\n|Parker Butte (NV-03572)|Stillwater|Maintain|Active|1,669|30,781|Gen-tie alignment|\n|Cleaver Peak (NV- 03010)|Sierra Front|Maintain|Active|1,250|51,664|Gen-tie alignment|\n\n\nSource: (BLM 2022)\n\nThe grazing operator is currently authorized to allow 603 cattle on the Perry Springs-Deadman and 670\ncattle on the Grey Hills allotment. On Perry Springs-Deadman, grazing is authorized between December 1\nto March 31. On the Grey Hills allotment, grazing is authorized from October 16 to April 1and again\nbetween June 5 to August 16. Within the Gray Hills Allotment, cattle are moved along the Reese River\nRoad corridor towards the proposed solar site from the west to east, and to areas south of the proposed\nsolar site in the vicinity of the Abraham Spring and Summit Spring.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.11-1 Grazing Allotments**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.11-2. Rangeland Improvements around the Project Site**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.11-3 Rangeland Improvements around the Gen-Tie**\n\n\n-----\n\nAccess to water influences where cattle can graze within the allotments. Currently, within the Gray Hills\nAllotment, a pipeline and water tank are located in the southwestern section of the Project solar site\n(Figure 3.11-2) where an approximately 20-acre section of solar panels is proposed. This water pipeline is\nsourced at Summit Spring, approximately 3 miles south of the proposed solar site. Another water line\nextends from the Abraham Spring (approximately 4 miles south of the solar site) to the west, over the\nadjacent hill, and then into the Mason Valley to the west of the southwestern portion of the solar site (also\nshown in Figure 3.11-2). A replacement of this pipeline was initiated by the Walker Basin Conservancy.\nThis pipeline flows to a tank, then branches and extends north to a trough and west to another tank at the\nbase of the hills.\n\nThe Perry Springs-Deadman Allotment is sourced with water through existing water wells (Figure\n3.11-3). Wells to the north of the Project solar site provide water for grazing within the allotment along\nthe proposed gen-tie. The closest well to the solar site is to the west of the northwest corner,\napproximately 1.25 miles away. This well is serviced by a gas-powered pumpjack motor that is unreliable\nand thus limits the grazing operator\u2019s access to the source of water needed to graze the areas adjacent to\nand west of the northwest portion of the proposed solar site.\n\n**3.11.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.11.4.1 Methods_**\nThe BLM provided data specific to the affected grazing permit areas, including historical range\nimprovements such as fencing and water infrastructure. Additional field data and information was\ncollected by Panorama on a site visit with the BLM, the Applicant, and the current grazing operator in\nApril 2023 and October 2023. A due diligence report was also performed by EnviroMine that included a\nreview of grazing permits (EnviroMine 2022). The report is included in Appendix B of the Land Use and\nCorridor Report for the Project (Panorama 2023). Desktop analysis of BLM planning documents and\nassociated GIS data resources were also compiled.\n\n**_3.11.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Access Road - Access Impacts.** The grazing operator currently grazes the solar site area and surrounding\nareas within the Gray Hills Allotment and the Perry Springs-Deadman Allotment from December to April\nwith a permitted level of 603 head of cattle on Perry Springs-Deadman and 670 on Gray Hills. In\naccordance with Solar PEIS PDF RG 2-1, access from Reese River Road to both allotments and the\nassociated range infrastructure would remain open and maintained during construction (BLM and U.S.\nDOE 2012). An existing cattleguard on Reese River Road may need removal during construction to\naccommodate heavy truck traffic but would be replaced upon completion of the construction phase.\nExisting fencing alignments, shown in Figure 3.11-2, would be modified around the Project solar site.\nConstruction would require a large number of vehicles, including heavy vehicles delivering construction\nequipment and solar facility components. The use of East Walker Road and Reese River Road for\nconstruction may create conflicts for livestock movement; however, conflict and safety hazards for the\ngrazing operator would be minimized through coordination to ensure safe movement of livestock along\nthese roads to grazing destinations, as defined in Solar PEIS PDF RG2-1.\n\nThe construction of the Project could present an impediment to grazing and water access to the south of\nthe Project site. A pipeline and tank is located within a 20-acre area of panels at the junction of Reese\nRiver Road and Old State Road 2C (Figure 3.11-2). The grazing operator needs this area to gather cattle,\nwater them, and move them south towards the corral and grazing areas south of the solar site. To reduce\nimpacts to grazing operation access, MM RG-1 includes during final design, removing this 20 acres of\npanels and redistributing them throughout the other areas of the solar site, minimizing impacts to access.\n\n**Solar Site \u2013 Loss of Grazing Areas/AUMs.** Construction and O&M of the Project solar site would\nrequire closure of approximately 1,722 acres from the Gray Hills allotment and approximately 3,419 acres\nfrom the Perry Springs-Deadman allotment, representing 1.7 percent and 6.9 percent of the total\n\n\n-----\n\nallotments, respectively, or a combined 3.1 percent. This loss corresponds to 218 AUMs out of a total of\n7,150 AUMs in the two allotments, and the associated forage. The permit holder would be provided a two\nyear notification letter under 43 CFR 4110.4-2 of the Project\u2019s need to preclude grazing in accordance\nwith the CRMP Grazing Livestock Management SOP 9 (BLM 2001b). Since the grazing operator\ncurrently utilizes the solar site and surrounding area to graze cattle, the loss would be considered an\nadverse effect.\n\nMM RG-1 would be implemented to reduce the adverse effect of the loss of 3.1 percent of the AUMs in\nthe allotments. The grazing operator has indicated that they could graze other areas of their allotments if\nexisting water sources could be improved, and once the pipeline replacement is completed by the Walker\nBasin Conservancy. With improvements, including completion of the pipeline replacement, the areas to\nthe southwest of the Project solar site could be grazed. The areas to the northwest of the solar site could\nalso be grazed with improvements to an existing well. These improvements would allow for the grazing\noperator to maintain their current grazing operations and would not displace or require them to scale\ndown their operations even with the loss of the solar site area, and even at fully permitted grazing levels.\nMM RG-1 requires the Applicant to work with the grazing operator to fund these water conveyance\nimprovements, thus minimizing impacts to the grazing operations. The Project\u2019s construction (and O&M)\nwould still result in the loss of 218 AUMs and forage, but with mitigation, the loss would not make\nlivestock production uneconomical for the grazing operator.\n\nMM RG-1 would minimize effects to grazing operations but could result in other types of impacts. Key\nimpacts from potential improvements to water infrastructure, as identified under MM RG-1, are\nsummarized in the following table. These impacts assume activities such as upgrading the stockwater well\nwith solar panels or additional power, completion of the stockwater pipeline from Abraham Springs and\ninstallation of replacement tanks or troughs, and habitat and fence replacements or improvements to\nSummit and Abraham springs. Other infrastructure improvements may be proposed and may require\nadditional NEPA analysis prior to authorization of the work. The Applicant would assist with additional\nNEPA approvals for these improvements, if needed.\n\n**Table 3.11-2** **Summary of Potential NEPA Impacts from Range Improvements**\n\n\n\n|Topic|Summary of potential impacts and analysis|\n|---|---|\n|Air Quality and Soils|Air quality and soils impacts from potential water conveyance improvements are expected to be limited in extent, as construction for the types of improvements that may be installed would not require substantial ground and soil disturbance. The replacement of water lines is performed using small equipment, as the lines are typically 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter and installed one to two feet underground. Some soil would be displacement but would be replaced to rebury the lines. Solar panel installation at the stockwater well would not require substantial grading nor would fence improvements at the existing springs. The well is currently operated using a gas engine, and as such, emissions from the engine may be offset with either a higher efficiency engine or solar panels. Air quality impacts exceeding standards are not expected.|\n|Biology and Water Resources|No federal or State-listed threatened and endangered species are found in the area. Special status plants and animals may experience minor disturbance from noise during construction, but it would be similar to that experienced during movement of cattle. Improvements to the springs would benefit big game species, vegetation, and water quality by preventing wild horses from creating sedimentation and ground disruption at the springs. Vegetation and wildlife measures identified in this EIS could be implemented as appropriate to minimize effects. Drainages would not be impacted by the range improvements, since they would largely be maintenance or replacement of existing infrastructure. No changes to landforms or drainages would occur, except to benefit the water quality and habitat around the springs.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Topic|Summary of potential impacts and analysis|\n|---|---|\n|Cultural|Most areas are currently disturbed, and the improvements would not involve extensive grading or ground disturbance. Surveys should be conducted for any areas of new ground disturbance and if archaeological or historic resources are found, they should be avoided to minimize effects.|\n|Land Use and Recreation|No impacts to land uses or recreation would occur from any proposed range improvements. Improvements would primarily be to existing infrastructure under maintenance.|\n|Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice|No impacts to socioeconomics or environmental justice would occur as the range improvement work would only require a few workers to complete and would not result in other environmental impacts that could affect environmental justice communities.|\n|Public Health and Safety|No impacts to public health and safety are anticipated from the range improvements, nor any increased risks of fire. The improvements will likely bring water sources to more areas, thus improving potential for extinguishing a fire, should one break out.|\n|Transportation|A few workers would be needed to complete range improvements. These workers would not impact traffic or transportation routes.|\n|Visual Resources|Visual impacts of improvements would likely be minor and would be in character with existing improvements, including tanks, fences, and troughs. Any improvements would likely be in the same area as existing features and thus would not alter the visual character of the area. Improvements to power the grazing operator\u2019s stock water well could include placement of solar panels, which would have some visual impacts, but the area of panels would be limited to a few dozen panels in the location of the existing disturbed corral. Visual impacts of panels in this area would not result in contrast given proximity to the solar site, and the general disturbance in the area of the panels.|\n\n\n**Gen-tie \u2013 Access and AUM Impacts.** Short-term construction related impacts would be expected during\ninstallation of the gen-tie line poles within the Black Mountain, Parker Butte, Perry Springs-Deadman,\nand Cleaver Peak allotments. Given heavy equipment travel on small roads, some potential for conflict\nwith moving or grazing livestock is possible, which would be an adverse effect if livestock are injured or\nkilled or if grazing operations are impeded. Prior to construction, the Applicant would communicate the\nconstruction schedule and access timing with the grazing permit holders and grazing operator to avoid\npotential interference with any active grazing in that area, per MM RG-1, minimizing effects. If the\ngrazing operators\u2019 fencing is required to be removed or relocated, the Applicant would replace the range\ninfrastructure in cooperation with the grazing operator to maintain existing operation levels. Construction\nof fencing would be in accordance with the CRMP SOP 3 (Livestock Grazing Management). Existing\naccess roads would be utilized wherever possible. Installation of new access roads to pole locations would\nlikely require minor grading and removal of vegetation within the affected allotments; however,\ndisturbance would result in a small loss of vegetative cover and is not expected to impact forage\nresources. In the long term, a permanent 150- or 200-foot-wide ROW corridor for the gen-tie would\nremain; however, grazing could continue within it. Some loss of potential forage would occur around the\nbase of gen-tie poles and new road spurs, totaling approximately 64 acres plus an additional 100 acres for\ntemporary pull and tension sites during construction across the 24.1-mile-long gen-tie. The total acreage\nfor the allotments within which the gen-tie poles and access roads would be located is 58.2 acres, a\n0.0004 percent reduction in overall grazing acres. This reduction would not have economic effects on the\n\n\n-----\n\nallotment holders and thus would not be adverse. Most of the gen-tie alignment is within an existing\ndesignated utility corridor.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\nOperation and maintenance activities would have the same impacts as those described for construction.\nAccess from Reese River Road to both allotments and the associated range infrastructure would remain\nopen post construction, and the road would be widened with the surface maintained, likely making access\neasier for the grazing operator. Modifications to fencing and water infrastructure would be implemented\nthroughout the life of the Project. Under MM RG-1, the 20-acre area of panels near existing water\ninfrastructure and juncture for cattle movement would be removed and redistributed in the main body of\nthe solar site and support would be provided to improve access to water. Grazing infrastructure (e.g.,\nfences) affected by the Project would be replaced or compensation provided. As identified for the\nconstruction analysis, the amount of permanent loss of available rangeland that would make livestock\nproduction uneconomical would not occur with enhancement of water and infrastructure to allow for\ngrazing of other areas within the allotment. The loss of 218 AUMs, corresponding to 3.1 percent of the\nexisting allotments would still occur.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nDecommissioning would include removal of the Project fencing. The Applicant would coordinate with\nBLM and the grazing permit holder to reinstall fencing for grazing activities in accordance with the\nAllotment Management Plan applicable to the grazing permits at that time. The groundwater well and\nassociated stock water rights may be transferred to the grazing permit holder and would likely remain in\noperation for future livestock use, a long-term beneficial impact. The solar site would be revegetated in\naccordance with the CRMP Livestock Grazing Management SOP 6 and the Decommissioning and Site\nReclamation Plan, and roads would be rehabilitated in accordance with the CRMP Livestock Grazing\nManagement SOP 2. The site would be eligible for future inclusion for BLM permitted grazing upon\ncomplete establishment of vegetation; however, regrowth of vegetation may take many decades to a\ncentury or more and thus would be considered a loss even after decommissioning. Due to the additional\nstock water source, grazing of the allotment would continue after decommissioning as it did during O&M.\nDecommissioning of the Project is not anticipated to have significant adverse impacts to rangeland\nresources and eventually the site may be productive again.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nApproximately 18 percent of the Perry Springs-Deadman grazing allotment was closed due to recent\nexpansion of the Pumpkin Hollow Copper mine located immediately north of the proposed solar site\n(BLM 2015). The closure of an additional 6.9 percent of the permit area due to the Project is recognized\nas an adverse cumulative impact to the Perry Springs-Deadman grazing allotment. Due to the regional\nincrease in utility-scale solar projects proposed within BLM grazing allotments, the Project also\ncumulatively contributes an overall reduction in available grazing area. Multiple other proposed utilityscale solar projects are in the early planning stages within and near the Parker Butte and Cleaver Peak\nallotments. The Project\u2019s contribution would be reduced with the provision of additional water sources\nthat would increase grazing opportunities to the area immediately west of the Project site, to offset those\nlost. The Project would still contribute incrementally to a cumulative loss of grazing lands.\n\n**_3.11.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nConstruction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts to rangeland resources under\nAlternative 1 would be similar as described for the Proposed Action because the same amount of grazing\nallotment acres would be removed, and the same Project components would be installed. The increase in\nretained and restored vegetation at decommissioning would reduce the amount of time the land is\nexcluded from future rangeland activity, which would represent a reduced impact to rangeland resources\nover the long term. The same PDFs and MMs as identified for the Proposed Action would be\nimplemented for Alternative 1 to minimize adverse effects. This alternative removes the 20 acres of\npanels within the critical area for grazing operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.11.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nConstruction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts to rangeland resources under\nAlternative 2 would be the same as described for the Proposed Action. This alternative would include\nutilizing supplemental access routes to the solar site during construction. This alternative would have the\nsame impacts with regard to the solar site and gen-tie as the Proposed Action since these components of\nthe Project are the same under this alternative. Providing some supplemental access during construction\ncould reduce some traffic on East Walker Road and Reese River Road and thus could result in fewer\nconflicts with livestock and livestock transport. The same PDFs and MMs as identified for the Proposed\nAction would be implemented for Alternative 1 to minimize adverse effects.\n\n**_3.11.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-Tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\n\n**Construction and Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\nAlternative 3 would have reduced construction and O&M related impacts to rangeland resources overall\ndue to the reduction in construction activity along the gen-tie alignment. There would be no impacts to the\nBlack Mountain, Parker Butte, or Cleaver Peak allotments. Impacts to the Perry Springs-Deadman\nallotment, however, would increase by approximately 11.8 acres for the 0.54-mile-long gen-tie and\nswitching station. The Proposed Action includes approximately 58 acres of disturbance for new road\nspurs and transmission poles that would be eliminated, such that the overall impact would be reduced\nunder this alternative for the Perry-Springs-Deadman allotment.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nDecommissioning impacts to rangeland resources would be reduced overall as compared to the Proposed\nAction, due to the reduction in length of the gen-tie alignment. Decommissioning impacts at the solar site\nwould be the same as described for the Proposed Action.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nAlternative 3 would contribute the same adverse cumulative impacts to rangeland resources as described\nfor the Proposed Action due to the removal of roughly the same amount of acres from grazing allotments.\n\n**_3.11.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nThe Project would not be implemented under the No Action alternative. No adverse effects to rangeland\nand grazing would occur.\n\n**_3.11.4.7 Relevant Required Solar PEIS Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP_**\n**_Standard Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Solar PEIS Programmatic Design Features**\nApplicable Solar PEIS PDFs are listed in Appendix B. The Project would comply with the following\nPDFs to minimize impacts to rangeland resources:\n\n-  RG2-1\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nSOPs from the CRMP (BLM 2001b) are listed in Appendix B. The following SOPs would minimize\nimpacts to rangeland resources:\n\n-  Livestock and Grazing SOPs 2, 3, 6, 9, 10\n\n-  Land Use and Realty SOPs 5, 6\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans, required by the BLM ROW grant, would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize impacts to rangeland resources:\n\n-  Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts on\nrangeland resources:\n\n**MM RG-1: Grazing Operator Coordination and Compensation**\n\nThe existing pipelines, fences, and other water infrastructure shall remain in place and remain accessible\nto the grazing operator during construction and operation of the solar site and gen-tie. Solar panels located\nin an approximately 20-acre area at the junction of Reese River Road and Old State Road 2C shall be\nremoved and redistributed throughout the main body of the site to maintain this 20-acre area as an\nimportant area for access by the grazing operator. Any pipelines, fences, or other grazing infrastructure\nshall be avoided during construction or otherwise replaced in the final design of the Project solar site, or\ncompensation shall be provided to the grazing permit holder based on the replacement value of the\ninfrastructure. At a minimum, the Applicant shall also coordinate with the grazing operator to improve\nlivestock watering conveyance to underutilized pastures near the Project area. The support provided (e.g.,\nenvironmental, financial/funding, and/or construction support scope and term) shall be documented\nthrough a written agreement with the grazing operator prior to construction. For infrastructure\nimprovements supported by the Applicant that extend beyond the solar site boundary, (e.g., to the stock\nwater well to the northwest of the Project solar site, to the pipeline and trough and tank infrastructure to\nthe south of the Project solar site, or to the springs to the southeast of the Project solar site) the Applicant\nshall work with the grazing operator and BLM to ensure the appropriate permitting and documentation of\nthe rangeland improvements is completed.\n\n**MM RG-2: Maintain Access to Grazing Allotments**\n\nDuring construction, the Applicant shall coordinate with the grazing permit holder to ensure that access\nalong East Walker Road and Reese River Road to the allotments is open and safe for passage without\ndelays to the permit holder. The Applicant shall include measures in their construction contracts to ensure\nthat workers avoid livestock and follow speed limits on roads to avoid collisions and injury. Any\nlivestock accidentally injured or killed by Project activities shall be compensated for to the permit holder\nat a market rate.\n\n**_3.11.4.8 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nNo irreversible or irretrievable impacts that would affect rangeland resources. The loss of 218 AUMs,\neven though grazing operations could be sustained with mitigation, would represent an adverse, residual\nimpact. The impact would be reduced at decommissioning under Alternative 1.\n\n##### 3.12 Recreation\n\n**3.12.1 Introduction**\nThis section addresses potential Project-related physical alterations or other impacts to established,\ndesignated, dispersed, or planned recreation areas, resources, experiences, activities, or outcomes. Impacts\nto public access are evaluated in accordance with Secretarial Order 3373: Evaluating Public Access and\nthe BLM Public Land Disposals and Exchanges. NDOW manages hunting in Nevada through three\nregional offices, each overseeing hunting in a series of game management units (GMUs) and hunting\nunits (HUs) within each GMU.\n\n**3.12.2 Analysis Area**\nThe area of analysis for recreation is the extent of land that could be directly affected by the Project and\nwhere access, opportunity, or experience to recreational opportunities could be directly or indirectly\naffected. Project impacts resulting from construction, O&M, and decommissioning activities have the\npotential to affect recreational resources both in the Project area and, to some degree, in proximity to the\nProject area due to indirect impacts such as noise and dust.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.12.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.12.3.1 Introduction_**\nThis section describes the recreational setting in terms of recreational opportunities in the analysis area,\nincluding designated recreation sites, recreation access points, designated trails, and dispersed and nondesignated recreation activities. Recreational opportunities within the analysis area are administered by\nthe BLM under the CRMP (BLM 2001). Three main categories of recreation are found on BLMadministered lands: dispersed recreation, developed recreation, and SRP. OHV use is a popular dispersed\nrecreation activity on public lands in the Carson City District Office planning area.\n\n**_3.12.3.2 Recreation Management Areas_**\nRecreation management areas are the BLM\u2019s primary means of managing recreational use of public\nlands. An area of public land may be designated as a special recreation management area (SRMA) or\nextensive recreation management area (ERMA). The Project area is not located within any SRMA or\nERMA.\n\n**_3.12.3.3 State Designated Recreation Areas_**\nThe State-managed Pitchfork Ranch section of the Walker River State Recreation Area is located\napproximately 5 miles east of the Project area along East Walker Road (as shown in Figure 3.12-1). The\nProject access road along East Walker Road provides access to and is partially located on the Walker\nRiver State Recreation Area.\n\nThe Mason Valley WMA is located north of Yerington, Nevada. The proposed gen-tie alignment borders\nthe WMA to the east and south, nearly surrounding the Fort Churchill substation. The proposed gen-tie\nalignment crosses a small portion of the most northern section of the Mason Valley WMA. No other\nWMAs are located within or near the Project components (including the Project solar site, gen-tie, and\naccess road).\n\n**_3.12.3.4 Recreational Uses_**\n\n**Off-highway Vehicles**\nOHV travel in the Project area occurs on existing roads, trails, and dry washes (as shown in Figure\n3.12-1). OHV use falls under _limited_ _use_ in the Project area, which means OHV use is limited to existing\nroads and trails.\n\nRoutes are cooperatively managed between the BLM and the State of Nevada. Four trail types used for\nrecreation purposes are located within the Project boundary: BLM OHV SRP, OHV Route, Old State\nRoad 2C, and Reese River Road (BLM 2023a; 2023b). Table 3.12-1 provides the distances of the trail\ntypes within the Project solar site. The BLM Nevada State Office is developing a programmatic\nEnvironmental Assessment that will cover a range of SRPs for OHV events in Nevada (BLM 2023c). One\nof the routes within the Stillwater Field Office crosses through the southeastern Project site along Old\nState Road 2C. Routes within the Sierra Front Field Office cross the proposed gen-tie alignment, south of\nUS 95A (BLM 2023a; 2023b).\n\n**Table 3.12-1** **Recreational Trails within the Project Solar Site**\n\n|Trail type|Total distance of trails (miles)|\n|---|---|\n|BLM OHV SRP|2.1|\n|OHV route|14|\n|Old State Road 2C|1.5|\n|Reese River Road|0.8|\n\n\n\nSource: (BLM 2023a; 2023b; Nevada Offroad Association 2023)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.12-1 Off Highway Vehicle Routes**\n\nSource: (Nevada Offroad Association 2023)\n\n\n-----\n\nOld State Road 2C provides access to the Walker Lake SRMA by OHV. The road is unmaintained and is\nunlikely to be used by passenger vehicles. Consultation with the Executive Director of the Nevada\nOffroad Association determined that Old State Road 2C provides important access through the western\nfront of the Wassuk Range to the northern end of the Walker Lake area and may be part of future BLM\nSRP events. The Nevada Offroad Association also identified a racecourse north of the Project solar site\nthat the proposed gen-tie would cross (as shown in Figure 3.12-1) (Nevada Offroad Association 2023).\n\n**Hiking**\nHiking may occur in limited capacity along the unpaved trails commonly used by OHV users. However,\nhiking use is likely low due to the lack of sites of interest in the immediate vicinity. Hikers most likely\nfrequent the nearby features such as Walker River SRA and Mason Valley WMA.\n\n**Camping**\nDispersed camping is currently permitted within the Project analysis area and surrounding areas.\nHowever, camping use is likely low due to the lack of designated camping sites and lack of sites of\ninterest in the immediate vicinity. Camping in the area predominately occurs at the Walker River State\nRecreation Area and Mason Valley WMA.\n\n**Hunting and Target Shooting**\nThe solar site and gen-tie fall within GMU 20, which is comprised of eight HUs, two of which cross the\nProject area (202 and 203). The general hunting season for these game units include:\n\n-  Antelope: August 1 to October 30\n\n-  Desert Bighorn Sheep: October 15 to January 1\n\n-  Mule Deer: August 10 to September 9 and November 5 to January 1\n\nHUs extend up over the Mason Valley WMA, where the gen-tie would be located. Mule deer and\nantelope can be found in this area, as well as waterfowl. Bighorn sheep are most commonly found at the\nhigher elevations of the Wassuk Range, outside of the Project area (NDOW 2017). No designated\nshooting areas occur within the Project area, but undesignated target shooting may occur within the\nProject area or nearby.\n\n**3.12.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**3.12.4.1** **_Methods_**\nDetermination of potential impacts to recreation from the Proposed Action and alternatives is primarily\nbased on existing recreation resource management data provided by the BLM CCDO. GIS information\nand recent aerial images were also used in this analysis to identify potential non-designated recreational\nopportunities and uses. Adverse impacts were determined based on whether the Project would diminish\npublic or private recreational use of or access to developed recreation sites and undeveloped recreation\nareas in the Project vicinity.\n\n**_3.12.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Solar Site.** Recreational uses would be prohibited on the 5,141-acre Project solar site during construction.\nA perimeter fence would be erected that would prohibit public access to the entire Project solar site;\nhowever, in compliance with Western Solar Plan PDF R1-1, Reese River Road and Old State Road 2C\nwould remain open through the Project solar site for recreational access throughout all Project phases,\nincluding SRP events. Fencing would be placed outside the roadway allowing traffic through the site. The\nperimeter fence would be an approximately 6- to 7-foot-high chain link fence with 1-foot-high barbedwire security strands at the top.\n\nSome existing OHV trails within the solar site would be removed from OHV access and use.\nApproximately 14 miles of OHV routes within the solar site would be closed during construction. The\n\n\n-----\n\n2.1-mile portion of the BLM\u2019s OHV SRP route within the Project area would remain open so that races\ncould continue through the solar site. Also, key OHV routes along Old State Road 2C and Reese River\nRoad would also remain open through the site for OHV use. Per MM REC-1, the Applicant would\ncoordinate with the OHV community during races to ensure safe access since the same roads would also\nbe used for construction traffic.\n\nHunting, hiking, and camping would be prohibited on the Project solar site during construction; however,\nthe area does not see high use of any of these activities. HU 202, in which the Project solar site is located,\nis approximately 570,000 acres. The solar site comprises 0.1 percent of the total HU area and thus the loss\nof this area for hunting during construction would not be adverse.\n\nPotential impacts to visual resources are discussed in detail in Section _3.13: Visual Resources._ Views of\nconstruction of the Project would change the recreational experience from the current natural views of the\ndesert landscape and would appear more industrial and developed. Construction noise might be audible to\nrecreational users during the 16-month construction period. However, construction noise would result in\nminor impacts to recreation users as construction noise would be temporary, short-term, and dispersed\nacross a large (approximately 5,141 acres) site that would diminish noise impacts.\n\n**Access Road.** Construction activities would cause a temporary increase in truck traffic along East Walker\nRoad, Reese River Road, and Old State Road 2C. Access to the Walker River State Recreation Area from\nEast Walker Road would remain open throughout all Project phases, but users may be subject to higher\nlevels of traffic and delays along the roadway. Construction would occur between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.,\nMonday through Friday. Traffic and transportation impacts are addressed in detail in Section _3.17:_\n_Transportation and Traffic_ . The increase in vehicle traffic during construction is not expected to create\nunacceptable delays on East Walker Road, Reese River Road, or Old State Road 2C. Construction\nactivities would typically occur on weekdays when there is less dispersed recreation compared to\nweekends. A Traffic Management Plan would be prepared for the Project construction phase and would\ninclude coordination with State Lands to incorporate any limitations on access to accommodate special\nevents or periods of higher traffic to the State Recreation Area. Implementation of the Traffic\nManagement Plan protocols required as part of any BLM ROW grant would reduce any potential traffic\nimpacts during construction of the Project.\n\n**Gen-tie.** Gen-tie construction activities would proceed in a linear fashion. Gen-tie construction could\nhave minor and temporary impacts on OHV use as well as hiking and other similar types of activities\n(e.g., birdwatching) and hunting. Several OHV routes, OHV SRP routes, and OHV designated\nracecourses cross the proposed gen-tie alignment. If construction were to occur at the same time as a\nrecreation event, the construction activities may present a hazard. Per MM REC-1, the Applicant would\ncoordinate with the OHV community during races to ensure safe access where the routes may cross\nconstruction zones. Since the construction proceeds in a linear fashion, only short-term impacts would\noccur to any particular crossing of OHV tracks.\n\nHiking and birdwatching occur in the Mason Valley WMA. The gen-tie would cross less than 1,000 feet\nof the WMA near the Fort Churchill substation gen-tie terminus. Construction activities associated with\nthe gen-tie within the Mason Valley WMA are not anticipated to degrade the recreational experience\nwithin the WMA because they are limited in extent and/or would occur near existing transmission\ninfrastructure associated with the Fort Churchill Generating Station.\n\nThe gen-tie construction would occur within HUs 202 and 203. The proposed gen-tie alignment is within\nan area of active hunting for antelope and mule deer. Construction would generate some noise and\ndisturbances that could occur during hunting seasons, which would present temporary disturbance that\ncould push big game away from the immediate area of construction activity. The impacts would be short\nin duration (a few weeks at any given point) and localized. Hunting would not be adversely affected.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\n**Solar Site.** Approximately 5,141 acres of land that is currently open to dispersed recreation would be\nremoved from use for a period of approximately 30 years during the estimated life of the Project. The loss\n\n\n-----\n\nwould not be adverse as many other similar areas are available for these activities in the vicinity and\ngreater region. The Project would reduce total available OHV trail miles within the Mason Valley area.\nImpacts to OHV, hiking, camping, and hunting would be similar to that described for construction, with\nthe closure of some OHV routes, but the primary OHV SRP routes, Old State Road 2C, and Reese River\nRoad would remain open. Reese River Road and Old State Road 2C would be improved and widened\nmaking it a more accessible route for use by OHV.\n\nThe solar site could be visible to dispersed recreational users when they are in proximity to the site and\ntraveling through the site. Dispersed recreationalists in the Project area may be sensitive to visual changes\nin the landscape. Developing areas visible from recreational features and roads in the Project area could\ndegrade views that contribute to the recreational appeal of the area, which would have an adverse effect\nduring Project O&M. Visual resource impacts are addressed in detail in Section _3.13: Visual Resources_ .\nPDFs VR2-1 and VR2-3 would reduce adverse effects through color treatment of Project components and\nuse of anti-reflective coating on solar panels. Some indirect, adverse impacts on recreation from visual\nchanges would occur.\n\n**Access Road.** The access road to the solar site would have some Project-generated usage during O&M\nphase. Up to 15 workers may be on site daily and occasional additional traffic may be generated for\nmaintenance or panel washing. No conflicts with OHV use are anticipated. Access for hiking, camping,\nand hunting and to the Walker State Recreation Area would be unobstructed and unaffected. Access up to\nthe site along Reese River Road would be improved, making travel for these activities easier.\n\n**Gen-tie.** The gen-tie, once built, would not have adverse effects on OHV uses, hiking, camping, and\nhunting. The gen-tie would have adjacent access roads, which may provide additional access for OHV\nusers. None of the existing OHV routes, SRP OHV routes, or designated racecourses would be obstructed\nor impacted by the gen-tie. Few studies have been undertaken to understand if transmission lines, due in\nparticular to the noise they generate, are avoided by large game species such as mule deer and pronghorn.\nHowever, there have been anecdotal reports of pronghorns near existing transmission lines. Given that\ngen-tie generated noise drops off to ambient levels within a few hundred feet, and the gen-tie is sited near\nexisting transmission lines, impacts to the hunting units are not expected to be adverse. The gen-tie access\nroads may also provide improved access for hunters into hunting territories, which could be a benefit.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nThe effects of Project decommissioning on recreation access and opportunities, including OHV use,\nhiking, camping, and hunting would be similar to those discussed for construction. Decommissioning\ntypically requires less workforce, time, and resources than construction of a project. Project\ndecommissioning would occur following the Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan and Site\nDecommissioning and Reclamation Plan required as part of the BLM ROW grant. The plans would\noutline decommissioning activities, safety and protection measures, reclamation procedures, and\nmeasurable performance standards as well as notification and abandonment scheduling. The plans would\nalso include requirements for long-term monitoring and maintenance as needed to ensure that restoration\ngoals are attainable and completed. Visual, noise, and traffic impacts for Project decommissioning\nexperienced by recreational users are anticipated to be similar to those discussed above for construction.\nOnce decommissioned, the previously restricted (for the 30-year Project lease period) solar site would\nonce again become publicly accessible.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nThe effects on recreation from cumulative projects in the analysis area include existing transmission lines\nand corridors, future utility-scale solar projects, Greenlink West, and the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine\nexpansion. The Project would contribute to the overall increase in utility development on BLM lands,\ndisplacing recreational opportunity for the public.\n\nWhile the Project would result in the loss of 14 miles of designated OHV trails, this impact is minor\nbecause access to the BLM OHV SRP and Old State Road 2C would be maintained for the life of the\nProject. While proposed future solar projects could also impact access to recreation, no other projects\noverlap with the designated OHV trails impacted by the Project, which are all located south of US 95A.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are approximately 12,357 total miles of OHV trails within the Carson City District. The Project\u2019s\ncontribution to the loss of 14 miles of trails would not be a considerable contribution to overall recreation\naccess.\n\nSimilarly, cumulative impacts to hunting could also occur. Proposed future solar projects are within\nHU 203 near the Project gen-tie. The Project would contribute to an increase in access roads and\ntransmission infrastructure but would not displace or divert migrating game.\n\n**_3.12.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nConstruction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts from Alternative 1 on recreational\nresources would be similar to the Proposed Action. Avoided drainages as part of Alternative 1 may\nprovide additional OHV access. Approximately 2.25 additional miles of drainages would be left unfenced\nfor access under this alternative, as compared with the Proposed Action. Construction may also take a few\nmonths longer under this alternative, which could result in a slightly increased impact on recreation as\ncompared with the Proposed Action. MM REC-1 would be implemented to reduce potential for adverse\neffects from construction activities on access roads used by recreationalists to and through the solar site.\n\nDecommissioning impacts to recreational resources under Alternative 1 would be slightly reduced due to\nthe increase in vegetative cover, improving the visual quality of the site. The decommissioning schedule\nmay be slightly reduced, allowing for re-entry of recreationalists sooner than for the Proposed Action.\nImpacts from the gen-tie construction, O&M, and decommissioning would be the same as for the\nProposed Action.\n\n**_3.12.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nCompared to the Proposed Action, Alternative 2 would slightly reduce impacts to recreational uses\nassociated with access, primarily to the Walker River State Recreation Area, by moving some\nconstruction traffic away from East Walker Road. Effects from the solar site and gen-tie construction,\nO&M, decommissioning and cumulative impacts would be the same as described for the Proposed\nAction. MM REC-1 would remain applicable to minimize traffic conflicts and ensure safety of\nrecreationalists traveling on the same roads as being used for construction of the Project.\n\n**_3.12.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\n\n**Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Decommissioning Impacts**\nConstruction, O&M, and decommissioning impacts from this alternative would be the same as described\nfor the Proposed Action for the solar site and the access road. MM REC-1 would remain applicable to\nminimize traffic conflicts and ensure safety of recreationalists traveling on the same roads as being used\nfor construction of the Project.\n\nThe gen-tie would be reduced from a 24.1-mile-long line from the solar site to the Fort Churchill\nsubstation to a 0.54-mile-long line extending from the eastern boundary of the solar site to a new\nswitching station under the Greenlink West line. The gen-tie and switching station would not intersect\nwith any OHV routes, SRP OHV routes, or race routes, thus reducing impacts to these uses as compared\nwith the Proposed Action. Disturbances to hiking, camping, and hunting from construction, O&M, and\ndecommissioning would be reduced, given the much smaller impact footprint and acreages of the gen-tie\nunder this alternative as compared with the Proposed Action.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nUnder Alternative 3, there would be no construction of the 24.1-mile gen-tie line, which would eliminate\nthe Project\u2019s contribution to the increase in planned transmission infrastructure within the Mason Valley.\nThe Project would have the same loss of 14 miles of designated OHV trails. As described for the\nProposed Action, the loss of 14 out of 12,357 miles of designated OHV trails would not be a considerable\ncontribution to an overall potentially adverse effect. With the elimination of the 24.1-mile gen-tie line,\nAlternative 3 would not contribute to cumulative effects to hunting within HU 203.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.12.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the Project would not be constructed, operated, maintained, or\ndecommissioned; therefore, existing recreational uses would continue on the Project site and adjacent\npublic lands. The landscape and existing non-designated roads and trails would not be altered, and there\nwould be no changes to the scenery, traffic, or levels of noise. Therefore, the existing recreation activities,\nsettings, and experiences would remain the same, with no change from baseline conditions.\n\n**_3.12.4.7 Relevant Required Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP_**\n**_Standard Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nProgrammatic design features from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project would\ncomply with the following PDFs to minimize impacts to recreation resources:\n\n-  R1-1\n\n-  VR 2-1; VR 2-3\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nSOPs from the CRMP are listed in Appendix B. The following SOPs would minimize impacts to\nrecreation resources:\n\n-  Recreation SOP 6\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans required by the BLM ROW grant would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize impacts to recreation resources:\n\n-  Traffic Management Plan\n\n-  Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan _(Draft is available on the Project website)_\n\n-  Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts on\nrecreation resources:\n\n**MM REC-1: OHV and Recreational Safety**\n\nThe Applicant shall ensure that during construction, OHV users can safely pass through East Walker\nRoad, Reese River Road, and Old State Road 2C. The Traffic Management Plan shall include measures to\nensure safety, including flagging and escort, as needed. The Traffic Management Plan shall also address\npotential impacts to access to the Walker State Recreation Area from heavy traffic and may include\nlimitations on delivers or other measures during times of expected higher use (e.g., special events) at the\nWalker State Recreation Area.\n\n**_3.12.4.8 Irreversible, Irretrievable, and Residual Impacts_**\nRecreation opportunities that occur during the lifespan of the Project would be reinstated after Project\nreclamation is complete, which means that the loss would not be irreversible or irretrievable. However, it\ncould take years before the reclaimed site is open to recreational uses.\n\nSome residual effects to recreational access would occur even after application of mitigation due to the\nincreases in traffic and hazards from construction on East Walker Road, Reese River, and Old State Road\n2C. These residual effects would be minor.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.13 Visual Resources\n\n**3.13.1 Introduction**\nVisual resources (the landscape) consist of landforms (topography and soils), vegetation, bodies of waters\n(lakes, streams, and rivers), and human-made structures (roads, buildings, and modifications of the land,\nvegetation, and water). These elements of the landscape can be described in terms of their form, line,\ncolor, and texture. This section is based on information provided in the Visual Resources Technical\nReport (VRTR) (Panorama 2023). The VRTR was prepared to inventory and analyze visual resources and\nviews that could be adversely affected by the Project and to provide recommendations to minimize\neffects. The inventory and analysis in the VRTR were prepared in accordance with the BLM VRM\nsystem.\n\nFLPMA provides for the management and protection of public lands, including their scenic quality. Per\nsection 505a of FLPMA, ROW grants on federal lands must stipulate terms and conditions that would\nminimize damage to scenic quality and aesthetic values. The BLM manages land under its jurisdiction\naccording to the goals and policies outlined in their RMPs. The CRMP identifies the components of the\nVRM system that apply to lands within the Carson City District. The VRM system provides a means to\nidentify visual values, establish objectives through the RMP process for managing these values, and\nprovides timely inputs into proposed surface-disturbing projects to ensure that these objectives are met.\nThe CRMP requires that visual design considerations be incorporated into all surface-disturbing projects\nregardless of size or potential impact.\n\n**3.13.2 Analysis Area**\nThe area of analysis for visual resources is the Project\u2019s visual sphere of influence (VSOI), which is the\nextent that the Project could visually degrade the visible landscape. [6] The threshold for VSOI is the\nviewshed within approximately 15 miles of the Project area. A viewshed analysis was undertaken, as\nshown in Figure 3.13-1.\n\n**3.13.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.13.3.1 Visual Environment_**\nThe Project site is located along the lower part of a gently sloping _bajada_ , or series of coalescing alluvial\nfans, which extends up into the Wassuk Range, located approximately 6 miles to the east. Multiple\nbraided, ephemeral washes flow westward through the Project site and connect to the Walker River.\nBlack Mountain, a named peak, is located to the east of the Project site.\n\nBeyond Black Mountain, the Walker River Indian Reservation is located on the eastern portion of the\nWassuk Range, extending into the next valley to the east. The Project solar site diminishes from view as\nthe canyon is traversed before reaching Black Mountain. Southeast of the Project site, on the other side of\nthe Wassuk Range, is Walker Lake. Walker Lake, while located 10 miles from the Project site, is neither\nvisible nor in the same viewshed, the two being separated by the Wassuk Range.\n\nThe western Project area lies within a lowlands known as Pumpkin Hollow. Adjacent to the site to the\nwest is LADWP\u2019s 750 kV north\u2013south transmission line. The East Walker River flows in a northerly\n\n6 VSOI is a similar concept as viewshed but takes other environmental and qualitative factors into consideration that\nare not addressed in the viewshed model, such as the presence of intervening topography, vegetation, or structures\nthat may obstruct considerable views; the amount of or perceptibility of the project that may be visible from a location;\nand viewing angles or atmospheric conditions that would limit viewing distance thresholds.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-1 Proposed Libra Solar Project Area Viewshed**\n\nSource: (ESRI\u00ae 2012; ESRI 2011; U.S. Geological Survey 2016; 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\ndirection approximately 5 miles to the west of the Project area. The Walker River State Recreation Area is\nlocated along East Walker Road, approximately 5 miles to the west of the Project area. The agricultural\nand residential areas of the city of Yerington are also located across the valley, to the west of the East\nWalker River, and to the north of the Walker River State Recreation Area. Yerington comprises many\nagricultural operations that use water from the East Walker River and a small, but denser, commercial,\nand residential downtown located off of SR 208. A large historic pit-mining operation is located to the\nwest of the downtown area (Anaconda Copper Mine). Also, in Yerington and approximately 3 miles north\nand west of the Project solar site is the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine and its associated industrial\nfacilities.\n\nThe Project area, including the gen-tie and access road, and the majority of the immediate vicinity are\nundeveloped except for some unpaved access roads and limited rangeland features, both new and in\ndisrepair including fences, watering troughs, pipelines, and other storage structures. The vegetation types\nfound in the Project area are characteristic of local vegetation types and include shrublands associated\nwith arid valley floors and alluvial slopes.\n\n**_3.13.3.2 Visual Resources Inventory_**\nVisual conditions, viewer experience, and viewer response are studied through the identification and\nselection of the most critical and representative viewpoints, referred to as key observation points (KOPs).\nPreliminary KOPs were selected within the Project viewshed in coordination with the BLM and were\nrefined following a field investigation. The selected 10 KOPs are identified on Figure 3.13-1 and\ndescribed in Table 3.13-1. Of the 10 KOPs, five were selected in coordination with the BLM for full\nanalysis. The remaining five KOPs were not carried forward for full analysis but are included for\ninformational purposes and used to extrapolate anticipated visual impacts.\n\nThe BLM\u2019s assignment of VRM classes and associated management objectives are informed through a\nvisual resource inventory (VRI) process, as defined in the BLM Manual Handbook H 8410-1, which\ninvolves evaluating a landscape\u2019s visual values at a specific point in time (BLM 1986). VRI\nclassifications, with Class I representing the most visual value and Class IV representing the least visual\nvalue, are assigned to landscapes by applying a three-factor rating system of scenic quality, viewer\nsensitivity, and distance zones. Additional detail on the evaluation of those three factors is included in\nSection 3.2 of the VRTR. VRI classes are merely informational and do not assign management objectives.\nVRM classes, in contrast, define the BLM\u2019s RMP management decisions to preserve the existing\nlandscape characteristics or allow for landscape modifications, in some cases despite high visual value.\n\nThe BLM Carson City District Office conducted a visual resources inventory that included the Project\narea, published in November 2022 with the data most recently updated in September 2023 (BLM 2023).\nScenic quality across all Project components are rated as C, which is the lowest-value designation. All\nProject component locations have a viewer sensitivity designation of low or medium. The eastern portions\nof the Project solar site adjacent the mountain ranges are designated as background, indicating some level\nof visibility from public observation points, but scenic quality of the entire Project solar site is low (C)\ndue to commonness of the landscape for the region. The BLM VRI classifications for the Project area are\nshown in Figure 3.13-2. The entirety of the Project site is within VRI Class IV, which is the lowest\noverall visual value.\n\nThe Project area has no assigned VRM class. Therefore, the BLM Manual H-8410-1 guidance was\nfollowed to assign an interim VRM class to the Project area. In conformance with the BLM Manual H8410-1, the Project area was evaluated using the VRI ratings along with RMP objectives to assign an\ninterim VRM class. The Project area is within a scenic quality rating unit (SQRU) with a rating of C, the\nlowest rating. Viewer sensitivity was determined to be low to medium for the entire Project area. Scenic\nquality and viewer sensitivity rating forms are included in Appendix C of the VRTR. Distance zones were\nevaluated in Section 4.2.2 of the VRTR and inform the VRI Class determination.\n\nWith consideration of the above listed factors, the Project area has been assigned to VRM Class IV,\nwhich allows for landscape alterations with a high level of changes to the landscape characteristics.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.13-1 KOP Descriptions**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|KOP ID|Simulated or informational|Location|Description|Viewers|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2|Simulated|Hwy 339/CA-NHT|This viewpoint is along a major highway in the vicinity of farms and residential land uses as well as just west of the California National Historic Trail corridor.

Night sky qualities refer to conditions that affect nighttime visibility and the opportunity for\nstargazing, which are affected by both natural atmospheric conditions and lighting associated with human\nactivities. The most desirable night sky qualities occur in undeveloped areas, far away from urban areas\nwhere lower levels of nighttime sky glow occur (also known as light pollution). Yerington\u2019s night sky is\naffected by the regional proximity to the Reno and Carson City metropolitan areas. The Bortle scale is a\n9-level numeric scale that measures the night sky's brightness of a particular location. The scale ranges\nfrom Class 1, the darkest skies available on Earth, to Class 9, inner-city skies. The Bortle scale value in\nYerington is Class 4; however, the solar site is a Class 2, indicating limited light pollution and strong\nbrightness (Danko 2023).\n\n**3.13.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.13.4.1 Methods_**\n\n**Overview**\nThe impacts on visual resources and existing landscape conditions are based on the evaluation of adverse\nvisual change that would result from the Project for three primary factors: (1) scenic quality, (2) viewer\nsensitivity levels (expectations of viewer response to landscape changes), and (3) the extent of visual\ncontrast and whether that contrast would conflict with the BLM\u2019s VRM class objectives. Table 3.13-2\nsummarizes the impact analysis considerations for visual resources.\n\n**Table 3.13-2** **Impact Analysis Considerations for Visual Resources**\n\n\n\n|Impact factor|Impact threshold|\n|---|---|\n|Scenic quality (scenic landscape features and rating criteria)|Visually obvious degradation of the foreground character or scenic quality of a visually important landscape|\n|Viewer sensitivity levels (expected viewer response to landscape changes)|The degree to which visual change in the landscape would elicit an adverse response from most viewers, depending on visibility and distance|\n|Consistency with the BLM\u2019s class- designation management objectives|The degree to which visual change in the landscape for one or more rating factors would create contrast that would conflict with the BLM\u2019s management objectives according to the VRM classes assigned at the Project component location. Specific thresholds for each VRM class are provided in Table 3.13-4|\n\n\n**Scenic Quality**\nScenic quality impacts are determined based on the comparison of change caused by the Project with the\nscenic quality rating of the affected environment. The results are based on consideration of existing scenic\nquality ratings, existing landscape character, presence, or absence of existing industrial development (e.g.,\ntransmission lines, pipelines, similar energy developments), and the effect of introducing the Project\ncomponents into the landscape as either a new or additional cultural modification.\n\nThe scenic quality impact thresholds are as follows:\n\n-  Strong contrast: moderate impact\n\n-  Moderate contrast: low impact\n\n\n-----\n\n-  Weak contrast: low impact\n\n**Viewer Sensitivity and Distance Zones**\nAdverse effects on viewer sensitivity could occur, depending on the visual contrast and distance zone in\nwhich it is perceivable. Table 3.13-3 defines visual impacts to sensitive viewers based on contrast level.\n\n**Table 3.13-3** **Impacts to Sensitive Viewers Based on Visual Contrast for Areas with Moderate to**\n**Low Viewer Sensitivity**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Distance zone|Strong Visual Contrast|Moderate Visual Contrast|Weak Visual Contrast|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Immediate Foreground (0\u20130.5 mile)|High visual impact|Low visual impact|Low visual impact|\n|Foreground-Middleground (0.5\u20135.0 miles)|Moderate visual impact|Low visual impact|Low visual impact|\n|Background (5\u2013 15 miles)|Low visual impact|Low visual impact|Low visual impact|\n|Seldom seen> 15 miles|Low visual impact|Low visual impact|Low visual impact|\n\n\n**BLM Management Objectives**\nImpacts on adopted BLM management objectives are determined by evaluating contrast caused by the\nProject. The BLM\u2019s contrast rating process is used, which evaluates contrast rating changes from preproject to post-project conditions in terms of form, line, color, and texture, with consideration to\nland/water features, vegetation features, and structures.\n\nAs previously stated, the entire Project area (i.e., Project solar site, gen-tie lines, and access roads) has no\nVRM class designation but has been given an interim designation of VRM Class IV. As stipulated in the\nBLM Manual H-8410-1, the management objective for this class is to allow for management activities\nthat require major modification of the existing character of the landscape. The level of change to the\ncharacteristic landscape can be high. These management activities may dominate the view and be the\nmajor focus of viewer attention. However, every attempt should be made to minimize the impact of these\nactivities through careful location, minimal disturbance, and repeating the basic elements. Projects\nresulting in high contrast and major modifications can remain consistent with management objectives. A\nsignificant level of landscape alteration or contrast would remain consistent with VRM Class IV.\n\n**_3.13.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n_Visual Impacts._ Temporary adverse impacts to visual resources due to construction would be anticipated\nfrom the use of construction equipment, staging, and ground disturbance. Visual impacts from these\nactivities are expected to be short-term (16 months). Impacts to scenic quality and viewer sensitivity are\nexpected to be similar to that described for the O&M phase of the Project, as discussed in the following\nsection. Construction activities occurring in the immediate foreground and foreground-middleground of\nthe observer\u2019s view would result in higher contrasts and greater impacts on scenic quality and sensitive\nviewers than those at a farther distance. The greatest impacts would be on users of OHV roads in the\nimmediate vicinity of the Project solar site and gen-tie alignment, with construction occurring in close\nproximity on either side of the roads.\n\nDuring construction, short-term direct impacts on viewer sensitivity and scenic quality in the landscape\nare anticipated to be minor to moderate from all KOPs, similar to that of the long-term O&M phase of the\nProposed Action. Refer to the discussion of O&M in the VRTR for an in-depth analysis of scenic quality,\nviewer sensitivity, and VRM management objective consistency. Visual contrast for the construction\nphase would be consistent with Class IV VRM management objectives. Implementation of Western Solar\nPlan PDFs, including VR 2-4, would further reduce contrast during construction through a pre-\n\n\n-----\n\nconstruction meeting with the BLM or other designated visual/scenic resource specialist to coordinate the\nProject-construction VRM mitigation strategy.\n\n_Night Sky Impacts._ Nighttime construction activities are not anticipated. In the event isolated nighttime\nconstruction is required, it would require illumination to meet State and federal worker safety\nrequirements. To the greatest extent possible, the nighttime construction lighting would be directed\ndownward or toward the area to be illuminated and would be shielded from public view. Task-specific\nlighting would be used to the greatest extent practicable while complying with worker safety regulations.\nDue to the limited time and locations where nighttime work would occur, the effects on night sky would\nnot be adverse.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\n_Visual Impacts._ The Project would result in major landscape modifications and the introduction of\npermanent facilities to a primarily undeveloped area. Following construction, during the O&M phase, the\nextent of visual contrast due to landscape alterations, and how noticeable those changes would be to the\ncasual viewer, would vary by viewing location.\n\nTable 3.13-4 summarizes the Project\u2019s level of impact to scenic quality and viewer sensitivity,\npredominantly from the presence of the Project components in the landscape. Impacts to scenic quality\nand viewer sensitivity would be minor from all KOPs. The level of impact from each KOP, presented\nbelow in Table 3.13-4, was determined using the impact thresholds for a scenic quality rating of C\n(discussed in Section 3.2 of the VRTR) and impact levels according to visual contrast and distance zones,\nas shown in Table 3.13-3.\n\nThe Project would result in weak to moderate contrast when viewed from the KOPs, due to the\nintroduction of the solar arrays and associated structures into an undeveloped area. Simulations from the\nfive KOPs are shown in Figure 3.13-3 through Figure 3.13-12. The Project would not attract or focus\nattention of the casual viewer from most of the KOPs that were evaluated, with the exception of views\nalong portions of Reese River Road and Old State Road 2C (KOPs 4 and 5) where the Project solar site is\nin close proximity, and where the gen-tie line crosses US 95A (KOP 10). Moderate contrast at KOPs 4\nand 5 is expected to draw the attention of casual viewers but would not dominate attention within the\nviewshed and would be consistent with VRM Class IV management objectives. The gen-tie, where it\ncrosses US 95A, would present new head-on views but due to the existing poles and transmission lines\nthat run concurrently, the varying topography and landscape beyond the gen-tie, and the relatively short\nviewing time, visual impacts would be minor. The gen-tie also crosses and is located within the vicinity\nof the Mason Valley WMA and would be visible in this area. The Project would be discernible by the\ncasual viewer but would not attract attention in the middleground of the Mason Valley WMA because it\nwould be partially screened by the dense vegetation associated with the Walker River riparian corridor\nand the various sloughs of the WMA.\n\nGiven the viewing distance and low to medium viewer sensitivity, moderate contrast at these locations is\na minor impact. At the other evaluated KOPs, the Project components would be partially or completely\nscreened from view by topography and vegetation, and/or views of the Project components (including the\nsolar site and gen-tie) would not be prominent. The Project would not draw attention due to various\nfactors such as separation distance, viewing angle, or proximate natural landscape features that tend to\ndraw attention away from the Project. Implementation of the Western Solar Plan PDFs, including VR3-1\nand VR4-1, would further reduce contrast. PDFs include surface and color treatment and the retention of\nnative vegetation, as approved by the BLM, as well as continued consultation with the BLM throughout\nO&M. Site restoration activities would begin immediately following construction to reduce the likelihood\nof visual contrasts associated with erosion and invasive weed infestation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.13-4** **Summary of Contrast Rating Results and Conformance with VRM Objectives**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|KOP ID|KOP description|Degree of visual contrast|Viewing distance|Scenic quality rating|Scenic quality impact|Viewer sensitivity rating|Viewer sensitivity impact|Conforms with VRM Class IV?|Discussion|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2|Hwy 339/CA-NHT|Weak|11 miles (BG)|C|Low|Medium|Low|Yes|KOP 2 is located approximately 11 miles from the solar site and 13 miles from the gen-tie alignment. Solar arrays are expected to be slightly visible at this location if clear atmospheric conditions are present but would not draw the attention of the casual viewer. The gen-tie line structures would be obscured by the natural topography and would not be visible from this location. Weak contrast would be expected, and no mitigation is proposed. Views of the Project from KOP 2 would conform with VRM Class IV objectives.|\n|4|Reese River Road|Moderate|1 mile (FM)|C|Low|Low|Low|Yes|KOP 4 is located approximately 1 mile from the solar site and 4 miles from the gen-tie alignment. The solar arrays would be visible due to the proximity to the solar site. The solar arrays are expected to appear as horizontal lines on the landscape. Small, enclosed electrical housing structures are also expected to be noticeable. Western Solar Plan PDF VR 2-3 would be implemented, specifically to include design of the solar arrays to follow the natural contour of the land and painting of electrical housing units to reduce color contrast. Moderate contrast would be expected due to the visibility of the solar arrays in a previously undeveloped area although the Project would not dominate views of the natural landscape within the viewshed. No mitigation is proposed. Views of the Project from KOP 4 would conform with VRM Class IV objectives.|\n|5|Old State Road 2C|Moderate|1.7 miles (FM)|C|Low|Low|Low|Yes|KOP 5 is located approximately 0.7 mile from the solar site and 4 miles from the gen-tie alignment. The dark solar panels would be noticeable due to the elevated position of KOP 5 being approximately 150 feet higher than the nearest array and nearly 600 feet higher than the furthest likely visible array. Views of the Project from KOP 5 are expected to draw attention from the casual viewer, and moderate contrast would be expected due to the viewing position and visibility of the solar arrays in a previously undeveloped area, although they would not dominate the natural characteristics of the landscape within the viewshed. Western Solar Plan PDF VR 2-3 would be implemented, specifically to include design of the solar arrays to follow the natural contour of the land and painting of electrical housing units to reduce color contrast. No mitigation is proposed. Views of the Project from KOP 5 would conform with VRM Class IV objectives.|\n|7|Pistone-Black Mountain NCA|Weak|2.75 miles (FM)|C|Low|Medium|Low|Yes|KOP 7 is located approximately 2.75 miles from the solar site and 3.25 miles from the gen-tie alignment. The solar arrays would be visible through a minor gap in the mountain range due to the elevated viewing position, which is approximately 1,223 feet greater in elevation than the average Project elevation (5,234 feet). The gen-tie line would not be visible due to the natural topography. Weak contrast would be expected due to the elevated viewing position and visibility of the solar arrays in a previously undeveloped area, although the solar arrays would not dominate the natural characteristics of the landscape within the viewshed. Views of the Project from KOP 7 would conform with VRM Class IV objectives.|\n|10|Alternate US Hwy 95 (gen-tie Only)|Moderate|0.25 miles (IF)|C|Low|Low|Low|Yes|KOP 10 is located approximately 9 miles from the solar site and 0.25 mile from the gen-tie alignment. The solar arrays would not be visible from this location as the solar site would be completely obstructed by topography. Gen-tie poles and transmission lines would be visible on the skyline and head-on views. Moderate contrast would be expected due to proximity of viewers, but the gen-tie line is not anticipated to draw attention at KOP 10 due to the multiple other existing poles and transmission lines that would run concurrently and the varying topography and landscape beyond the gen-tie. Views of the Project from KOP 10 would conform with VRM Class IV objectives.|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-3 KOP 2 Existing Conditions**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-4 KOP 2 \u2013 Visual Simulation of the Proposed Action**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-5 KOP 4 Existing Conditions**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-6 KOP 4 \u2013 Visual Simulation of the Proposed Action**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-7 KOP 5- Existing Conditions**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-8 KOP 5 \u2013 Visual Simulation of the Proposed Action**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-9 KOP 7 \u2013 Existing Conditions**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-10 KOP 7 \u2013 Visual Simulations of Proposed Action**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-11 KOP 10 \u2013 Existing Conditions**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.13-12 KOP 10 \u2013 Visual Simulation of the Proposed Action**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Night Sky Impacts._ Task-specific lighting would be used to the greatest extent practicable in compliance\nwith worker safety regulations. Implementation of PDFs, including VR2-2 and VR3-1, would further\nminimize effects on night sky qualities and would not be adverse.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nImpacts on visual resources during the decommissioning phase of the Project would reduce contrasts\nassociated with the Project components, although bare ground contrast may be visible for decades to a\ncentury or longer. Site reclamation would be implemented to reduce impacts but would not fully eliminate\nthem. While natural recovery from disturbance in deserts is slow and can take decades, re-seeding\napplicable areas with native plant seed would assist with accelerating some revegetation. Revegetation\nmonitoring would be implemented, as described in the Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan.\nRemediation measures may be implemented if revegetation does not meet the success criteria. The Project\nsolar site may appear disturbed and contrast with the surrounding vegetated areas for several years, with\nsoils visible against the surrounding landscape; however, impacts would be similar to the O&M phase and\nwould be considered low given low to medium viewer sensitivity and low visual quality, and would\nremain in conformance with VRM Class IV. Visual impacts would diminish over time as the landscape\nstarts to return to a more natural condition. Implementation of PDFs, including VR4-1, would minimize\nadverse visual effects through reclamation with the BLM-approved on-site visual/scenic resource\nspecialists, such as a landscape architect, in advance of final reclamation activities.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nMultiple cumulative projects would involve installation of energy and transmission line facilities in the\nMason Valley area, including Greenlink West, located immediately adjacent the Project solar site and\ngen-tie line alignment. Other cumulative projects considered include the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine\nExpansion on nearby private land and the existing LADWP transmission line immediately west of the\nProject. The change in character from a natural landscape to one including views of solar panels and other\nindustrial facilities would constitute an adverse cumulative impact to the existing landscape. The Project\u2019s\nfacilities and gen-tie line would contribute to the adverse cumulative effect, including from Greenlink\nWest, which is another proposed 500 kV line that would likely be located within 1,000 feet of the\nproposed gen-tie alignment. Greenlink West would add another large-scale transmission line at the\ncrossing location of US 95A (KOP 10), which would compound the contrast and adverse visual effects at\nthat location. However, the area is within an existing utility corridor and also falls within an area that is\nconsistent with VRM Class IV, which allows for major visual changes and, thus, impacts are not\nconsidered cumulatively adverse.\n\n**_3.13.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\n**Construction and Operations and Maintenance Impacts**\nAlternative 1 would have similar impacts to the Proposed Action, as solar arrays would be present on\nroughly the same acreage of land. Impacts to scenic quality and viewer sensitivity would be slightly less\nthan the Proposed Action due to vegetation preservation and restoration under the solar arrays. The\nincrease in vegetated area and avoided drainages may reduce contrast, although this condition would only\nbe slightly noticeable within some immediate foreground views. Visual contrast would be the same.\nImplementation of Western Solar Plan PDFs for color treatments on facilities, maintenance and\nrestoration of vegetation and natural topography, and a Lighting Management Plan would reduce adverse\nimpacts.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nImpacts from decommissioning would be similar to those of the decommissioning phase of the Proposed\nAction although reduced due to an estimated 65 percent of the application area being vegetated by the\ntime of decommissioning (as compared with 36 percent under the Proposed Action). Revegetation would\nbe required for Alternative 1, although at a reduced scale than for the Proposed Action. A Site\nDecommissioning and Reclamation Plan and revegetation monitoring would be implemented as described\n\n\n-----\n\nin the Proposed Action. Measures to minimize adverse visual effects from decommissioning would be the\nsame as for the Proposed Action.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nFuture solar projects on BLM lands in the vicinity of the Project would likely incorporate similar\nvegetation maintenance measures as prescribed under Alternative 1. The cumulative visual impacts,\nhowever, would remain similar to those described for the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.13.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nAlternative 2 involves using supplemental access routes during the construction and, potentially,\ndecommissioning phase. No new roads or major road improvements would occur. Construction of the\nsolar site, gen-tie, and primary access roads would be the same as for the Proposed Action. Use of\nsupplemental access routes for a portion of the construction vehicle trips would not have visual impacts.\nImpacts and applicable PDFs would be the same as described for the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.13.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\nAlternative 3 would eliminate the visual impacts associated with the 24.1-mile-long gen-tie that is routed\nnorth past US 95A and over the Mason Valley to the Fort Churchill substation. The elimination of this\ngen-tie line would result in a reduced visual impact. This gen-tie would be replaced, however, with a\n0.54-mile-line gen-tie and access road to a new approximately 10-acre switching station to the east of the\nProject, between the solar site and the Greenlink West line.\n\nThe switching station would include a fenced area for transmission equipment. The equipment could be as\nhigh as 30 feet. The Project under this alternative would also introduce new transmission structures\nbetween the solar site and the Greenlink West line, in the existing designated Section 368 utility corridor.\nThe site proposed for the switching station would be in an area of more level topography on the bajada,\nbut at the base of a steep topographic increase. It would be approximately 1.5 miles north of the nearest\naccess route for recreationalists through the solar site and 2.5 miles north of Old State Road 2C. This\nalternative would have new visual impacts and would represent a major change in the landscape, but\nvisibility would be consistent with the developed nature of the solar facility and Greenlink West line. The\narea is consistent with VRM Class IV, and the Project under Alternative 3 would be consistent with VRM\nClass IV management objectives. Western Solar Plan visual resources PDFs would apply to Alternative 3\nfor both the solar site and the gen-tie. Visual impacts would not be considered adverse.\n\nImpacts from decommissioning Alternative 3 would be reduced as compared to the Proposed Action\nalthough similar due to the majority of disturbance being at the solar site. Reclamation would proceed at\nthe solar site as described for the Proposed Action, with visual contrast diminishing over time.\n\nAlternative 3 would have reduced adverse cumulative impacts by not contributing to the existing and\nplanned transmission line facilities within the area. The adverse cumulative impact due to the increase in\nsolar and industrial facilities within the Mason Valley would remain, as described for the Proposed\nAction.\n\n**_3.13.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, no changes would be implemented on the site and the existing\nenvironmental setting would be maintained. The Project solar site would not be expected to change\nnoticeably from existing conditions and would not result in the visual impacts described for the Proposed\nAction or alternatives. No new disturbance to the characteristic landscape would occur, and no new\nelements or patterns would be introduced to the area. Therefore, there would be no new visual impacts.\n\n**_3.13.4.7 Relevant Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP Standard_**\n**_Operating Procedures, Management Plans, Design Features and Mitigation_**\n**_Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nProgrammatic design features from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project would\ncomply with the following PDFs to minimize impacts to visual resources:\n\n\n-----\n\n-  VR1-1; 2-2; 2-3; 2-4; 3-1; 4-1\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nSOPs from the CRMP (BLM 2001) are listed in Appendix B. The following SOPs would minimize\nimpacts on visual resources:\n\n-  Visual Resource Management SOP 2, 3\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans, required by the BLM ROW grant, would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize impacts to visual resources:\n\n-  Lighting Management Plan (Draft is available on the Project website)\n\nNo additional mitigation measures are prescribed for the Project under the Proposed Action or the\nalternatives since no adverse effects to visual resources are expected.\n\n**_3.13.4.8 Irreversible or Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nChanges to the characteristic landscape would occur over the 30-year lifespan of the Project and would\nrepresent an irretrievable impact but would not create irreversible impacts. Beyond the life of the Project,\nthe visible structures and materials would be removed from the Project area. However, it could take\ndecades to a century or more before the Project footprint is no longer visible and the vegetation returns to\nits pre-construction condition. The vegetation that would be established during reclamation efforts would\ntake several growing seasons to establish, and the composition of species in the recovery area would for\nseveral seasons be visibly different from the original and surrounding vegetation communities. This\nvisible difference would allow for the Project footprint to be visible for many years beyond the Project\nlifespan and would represent an irreversible impact. Alternative 1 reduces this adverse effect. No\nmitigation is proposed; therefore, there would be no residual effects.\n\n##### 3.14 Socioeconomics\n\n**3.14.1 Introduction**\nThis section analyzes the impacts of the Project and alternatives on socioeconomic issues, which include\nProject-related economic expenditures and job creation, population and housing impacts, effects on\ntourism and recreation economies, and effects to property values. This section relies on the technical\nreport entitled Economic and Fiscal Impacts, Socioeconomic Assessment, Libra Solar Project (Triple\nPoint 2022).\n\n**3.14.2 Analysis Area**\nWorkers needed for the Project would be sourced from a seven-county area in Nevada, including Mineral\nCounty, Lyon County, Washoe County, Carson City, [7] Douglas County, Churchill County, and Storey\nCounty, with a small percentage potentially relocating closer to the Project area (mostly in Lyon County).\nThe analysis area for the socioeconomic analysis, therefore, encompasses this seven-county area. The\nanalysis is more heavily focused on direct impacts to Lyon and Mineral counties since the Project\ncomponents fall within these counties, including for employment, income, housing, and public services.\n\n7 Carson City is an independent city that Is not incorporated into any county.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.14.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.14.3.1 Demographics_**\n\n**Population**\nThe Project site is located in Mineral County adjacent to the Mineral County and Lyon County border in\nNevada. The proposed gen-tie alignment for the Project is located in both Mineral and Lyon counties. The\ncity of Yerington is the closest city to the Project area, with a population of 3,190 in 2020, and is located\napproximately 11 miles northwest of the Project solar site in Lyon County (U.S. Census Bureau 2021a).\nLyon County has a population of 55,667 and is twelve times Mineral County\u2019s population of 4,487 (U.S.\nCensus Bureau 2021a). When combined, the population of Lyon County and Mineral County is\napproximately 60,000 [8] , which is approximately 1.9 percent of the overall population in Nevada in 2020\n(America Counts Staff 2021). The population of the two-county region increased at an average annual\ngrowth rate of 0.1 percent from 2010 through 2017, with a more rapid average annual growth rate\nincrease of 1.9 percent after 2017. Overall, the two-county region\u2019s population has grown at an annual\nrate of 0.7 percent over the past decade to reach a total of 60,154 in 2020 based on migration into Lyon\nCounty. Figure 3.14-1 presents the population growth data for Lyon County and Mineral County from\n2010 to 2020.\n\nThe Washoe County boundary is located approximately 57 miles northwest from the Project site and\ncontains the largest population of the seven-county region, with almost half of the population located in\nthe City of Reno. Washoe County had a population increase of 12.4 percent from 2010 to 2020. Douglas\nCounty and Storey County are located 21 miles west and 45 miles northwest, respectively, from the\nProject site. Douglas County and Storey County had a population increase of 3.1 percent and 1.7 percent,\nrespectively, from 2010 to 2020. Carson City is located south of Reno and approximately 45 miles\nnorthwest from the Project site. The Churchill County boundary is approximately 17 miles northeast from\nthe Project site. Carson City and Churchill County had a population decrease of 0.2 and 1.4 percent,\nrespectively, from 2010 to 2020.\n\nTable **3.14-1** lists the seven-county region population changes from 2010 to 2021.\n\n**Employment and Income**\nThe median household income in Lyon County grew at an annual average growth rate of 2 percent\nthrough the last decade, reaching $58,814 in 2020. In contrast, Mineral County\u2019s median household\nincome declined at an annual average rate of 0.8 percent to $31,500 in 2020. In both cases, mean income\nis greater than median income, which is an indication of income disparity; however, that disparity does\nnot appear to be increasing except over the past 2 years in Mineral County. Figure 3.14-2, below, shows\nthe mean and median household incomes within Lyon County and Mineral County. The combined output\n(the value of all products and services produced) for Lyon and Mineral counties was $3.7 billion in 2020,\nincluding $1.9 billion of gross domestic product. Table 3.14-2 lists the top 15 industries as measured by\ntotal economic output.\n\n**Housing**\nThe total number of housing units across Lyon and Mineral counties increased from 24,770 in 2010 to\n26,394 units in 2020, for an annual average growth rate of 0.6 percent. Almost three-quarters of the\n26,394 housing units are single-family detached, and the balance largely comprises mobile homes. The\nnumber and share of vacant units declined over the past decade, from 4,673 in 2010 (or 19 percent) to\n2,730 (or 10.3 percent) by 2020. The majority of the vacant housing units (2,108 units or 77 percent of the\ntotal housing units) are rental units and are either single-family detached or mobile homes; however,\nmobile homes comprised the greatest share of vacant housing units at 29 percent. Since 2010, the rental\n\n8 The Decennial Census redistricting data found the total population to be 63,789; however, American Community\nSurvey (ACS) data is relied upon to analyze trends over time.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.14-1 Population Growth of Lyon and Mineral Counties**\n\n\n\n\n**Table 3.14-1** **Analysis Area Population (2010 to 2020)**\n\n|Analysis area|Population 2010|Population 2020|Percent change 2010 to 2020|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Mineral County|4,812|4,487|-6.8|\n|Lyon County|51,515|55,667|+8.1|\n|Washoe County|412,844|464,182|+12.4|\n|Carson City|55,375|55,244|-0.2|\n|Douglas County|47,042|48,486|+3.1|\n|Churchill County|24,946|24,606|-1.4|\n|Storey County|4,016|4,086|+1.7|\n|Nevada|2,633,331|3,030,261|+15.1|\n\n\n\nSource: (U.S. Census Bureau 2020; 2010)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.14-2 Household Income**\n\n\n\n\n**Table 3.14-2** **Top 15 Lyon County and Mineral County Industries by Total Economic Output,**\n\n|2020 (dollars)|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Industry description|Total output|\n|Owner-occupied dwellings|$287,799,352|\n|Secondary processing of other nonferrous metals|$168,217,384|\n|Other real estate|$110,534,606|\n|Employment and payroll of local government (education)|$102,011,829|\n|Asphalt shingle and coating materials manufacturing|$90,116,192|\n|Gold ore mining|$81,998,006|\n|Fabricated structural metal manufacturing|$79,008,159|\n|Metal mining services|$78,666,645|\n|Employment and payroll of local government (other services)|$75,256,370|\n|Paint and coating manufacturing|$70,189,979|\n|Copper, nickel, lead, and zinc mining|$66,726,778|\n|Warehousing and storage|$63,358,269|\n|Gambling industries (except casino hotels)|$61,849,024|\n|Limited-service restaurants|$57,722,001|\n|Cement manufacturing|$55,545,878|\n\n\n-----\n\nshare of vacant units has remained relatively consistent; however, the quantity has decreased from 3,753\nunits in 2010.

The majority of Nevada\u2019s tourism and recreation industry is\nconcentrated in Clark County within the Las Vegas metropolitan area, which provided 258,390 jobs in\n2021. In comparison, Lyon and Mineral counties provided 1,608 jobs in tourism or approximately 0.41\npercent of Nevada tourism jobs in 2021 (Nevada Governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development 2023). In\nMineral and Lyon counties, gambling industries (except casino hotels) and limited-service restaurants\nwere both within the top 15 industries for economic output, together generating over 119 million in\nannual sales in 2021 (see Table 3.14-2).\n\nOHV use is a common recreational activity occurring within Mason Valley, including the Project site;\nhowever, OHV recreation was not identified as one of the top 15 industries for economic output. For\nadditional discussion on OHV use in the area, refer to Section _3.12, Recreation_ .\n\n**_3.14.3.3 Access to Local Emergency Services_**\n\n**Police**\nThe Project solar site is located within BLM-administered land in Mineral County and would likely be\nserviced by the Mineral County Sheriff. The Mineral County Sheriff\u2019s office is located at 205 A Street, in\nHawthorne, Nevada, approximately 28 miles southeast of the Project solar site. The BLM\u2019s Law\nEnforcement and Security Region 3 provides services related to natural resource crimes on BLM land.\nYerington police provides the closest police service.\n\n**Fire Protection**\nThe BLM is responsible for responding to wildfires on the BLM-managed public land. However, the\nBLM is not responsible for responding to fires that are not considered wildfires. Fires not considered\nwildfires (e.g., structural fires, hazardous materials fires) would be responded to by the local jurisdiction.\nThe proposed Project would fall within the jurisdiction of the Mineral County Fire Department for the\nProject solar site and the Mason Valley Fire Protection District for the majority of the gen-tie line, which\nservices the city of Yerington and greater Mason Valley. The closest Mineral County Fire Department\nstation is in Schurz, approximately 8.1 miles east of the Project solar site. The closest Mason Valley Fire\nProtection District station is in Yerington, approximately 11.1 miles northwest of the Project solar site on\nSR 208.\n\n**Hospitals**\nThe closest hospital to the Project solar site is the South Lyon Medical Center located in Yerington,\napproximately 11.2 miles northwest. The South Lyon Medical Center serves as a public hospital district\nfor Lyon County and is the sole provider of health care in the area (South Lyon Medical Center, n.d.).\n\n**_3.14.3.4 Social_**\nThe Northern Paiute occupied the Mason Valley since around 1,000 after death (A.D.) (Nevada\nExpeditions, n.d.). In 1881, N.H.A. \u201cHock\u201d Mason drove cattle through the valley and returned in 1859 to\n\n\n-----\n\nsettle along the Walker River north of the city of Yerington. Agricultural crops were produced, including\nbarley, potatoes, and grain. Through the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, the city of Yerington\nhas remained a modest but important agricultural center (Nevada Expeditions, n.d.). In the 1900s, mining\nbecame a major industry in Mason Valley with the establishment of the Mason Valley Mine producing\ncopper, gold, silver, gypsum-anhydrite, and iron (Mining Town Archive, n.d.). Mining has continued to\nbe an important economic driver in the region as well as government, some manufacturing, and gambling.\nMineral County is also home to a large army ammunition depot (Hawthorne Army Depot). The primary\nindustries in the Lyon and Mineral counites are shown in Table 3.14-2.\n\n**3.14.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.14.4.1 Methods_**\nEconomic Impact Analysis for Planning (IMPLAN) modeling was used to estimate the economic impact\nof construction, O&M, and decommissioning of the Project over its planned 30-year lifetime within the\ncontext of the regional economy. The assessment estimated the direct impacts resulting from the\ndevelopment of the Project, as well as the indirect and induced impacts. Direct effects represent the initial\nchange in the industry in question while indirect effects are changes in inter-industry transactions as\nsupplying industries respond to increased demands from the directly affected industries. Induced effects\nreflect local spending changes resulting from income changes in the directly and indirectly affected\nindustry sectors. Temporary impacts are those occurring within the approximate 2-year construction\nperiod. Long-term impacts are those that would occur during the 30-year operation period.\n\nThis analysis uses the latest version of IMPLAN, which currently incorporates 546 industry sectors as\ndefined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The latest IMPLAN datasets are from 2020;\nhowever, as result of the global pandemic, the 2020 data contains various anomalies and is less\nrepresentative than the 2019 data for modeling economic impacts. Thus, 2019 is used as the \u201cdata year\u201d\nof this IMPLAN model. The modeling outcome and detailed methodology are provided in the technical\nreport entitled Economic and Fiscal Impacts, Socioeconomic Assessment, Libra Solar Project (Triple\nPoint 2022).\n\nBecause Project construction would require more power-generation construction workers than were\navailable in Lyon and Mineral counties in 2019, the model assumes construction would draw labor from\nthe seven-county region, with the majority of workers sourced from Washoe County. The assumptions are\nbased on the amount of energy construction employment available in each county.\n\n**_3.14.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Employment and Income.** The workforce at the Project site during the 16-month construction period\nwould vary; however, a peak of up to 700 workers would occur during the most intensive construction\nactivity. As of March 2022, there were 54 unemployed people in Mineral County and 825 in Lyon\nCounty. By August, these figures climbed to 89 and 1,174, respectively (BLS 2023a; 2023b). Given these\nunemployment numbers and the number of technically qualified employees needed, Project construction\nwould be expected to require workers to be drawn from outside the two-county region. Construction of\nthe Proposed Action would temporarily decrease the level of unemployment in Mineral and Lyon\ncounties. Most construction staff and workers would be expected to come from the labor pool present\nwithin Washoe County, but would also be sourced from Lyon County, Douglas County, Carson City,\nChurchill County, Storey County, and Mineral County. Table 3.14-4 presents the employment sourcing\nfor the Project during construction and the estimated share of the Project employment. Table 3.14-5\nsummarizes the direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts during construction of the Project. The\nProject would employ approximately 1,155 workers, with the majority (786) sourced from Washoe\nCounty. Note that this value is total jobs whereas the average number of workers on site at any one time is\nassumed to be 400 workers, with a peak of 700 workers. The total economic output from Project\nconstruction is approximately $656,100,000 in the seven-county region.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.14-4** **Assumed Distribution of Employment by County**\n\n|County|Project employment|Share of Project employment|\n|---|---|---|\n|Mineral|13|1.1%|\n|Lyon|102|8.7%|\n|Washoe|786|67.2%|\n|Carson City|100|8.5%|\n|Douglas|101|8.6%|\n|Churchill|34|2.9%|\n|Storey|34|2.9%|\n\n\n\n**Table 3.14-5** **Total Construction Impacts by Type and Category, 2022 Dollars (thousands)**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Type impact|Labor incomes|Average annual jobs|Intermediate expenditures|Other property income|Taxes on production|Total output|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Direct|$196,800|1,155|$135,900|$85,000|$9,500|$427,200|\n|Indirect|$26,900|224|$36,700|$12,700|$8,700|$85,100|\n|Induced|$41,700|416|$57,600|$33,700|$10,900|$143,900|\n|Total|$265,400|1,795|$230,200|$131,400|$29,100|$656,100|\n\n\nSource: (Triple Point 2022)\n\nThe indirect and induced labor income spending impacts would be major, accounting for 10.1 percent and\n15.7 percent of total labor income spending impacts, respectively. The total output for indirect and\ninduced impacts would be even larger, accounting for 13.0 percent and 21.9 percent of total output,\nrespectively. The effects on the seven-county economy as a result of the Project would be beneficial.\n\n**Tourism and Recreation-related Economic Impacts.** The Project site is occasionally used for\nrecreation. The Mason Valley and surrounding areas are used for recreation and tourism. Nearby\nrecreational activities, such as OHV recreation or hiking, may be impacted by the Project due to the visual\nchange from undeveloped land to a renewable development facility. Impacts to recreation are analyzed in\nSection 3.12.\n\nTwo major recreational trails crossing the Project site and would remain open for recreational use (Reese\nRiver Road and Old State Road 2C). Views of the Project when on these roads within the Project solar\nsite would be changed; however, ample recreational opportunities and trails are available within the\nvicinity of the Project area and regionally. Traffic increases generated by Project construction could\ntemporarily affect access to recreational opportunities near the Project site by causing traffic delays. The\nincrease in vehicle traffic and traffic delays during Project construction would be temporary, and a Traffic\nManagement Plan would implement protocols to reduce any potential traffic impacts during construction.\nSee Section _3.17 Traffic and Transportation_ for additional measures and analysis regarding traffic\nincreases. Given the other OHV trails that are located in more desirable locations of Mason Valley due to\ntopography, the Project would not be expected to induce a meaningful loss of recreation and tourism and\nassociated economic loss. The Project is also subject to the Western Solar Plan PDF S1-1, which includes\nmethods to minimize socioeconomic effects, such as developing a community monitoring program to\ngather data regarding the economic, fiscal, and social effects of a project or establishing vocational\n\n\n-----\n\ntraining programs to promote development of skills required by the solar industry. Adverse effects to\ntourism and recreation-related economic inputs from the Project are not expected.\n\n**Housing.** Construction of the Project would support 1,155 jobs from the seven-county region. Most of\nthese jobs are expected to be filled by workers commuting from nearby communities, while some workers\ncould seek housing near the Project site. It is assumed that workers relocating for the Project would\nrelocate to areas within a 45-minute drive or less to the site, which would include communities in and\naround Yerington and along the I-50 and I-95 corridors, including the communities of Stagecoach and\nSilver Springs. Relocation is expected to occur predominantly in Lyon County, with some relocation\npotentially expected to communities in Mineral County.\n\nMany labor force housing options would need to be pursued, including using transient lodging inventory\nduring part or all of the 16-month construction period. Only about 10 percent of the new power generation\nfacility construction workers required for the Project construction are estimated to currently reside within\nLyon and Mineral counties, as presented within\n\nTable 3.14-4. The majority of workers (67 percent) are expected to commute from Washoe County. The\nremainder would commute from the other counties within the area or relocate near the Project site. The\navailability of vacant housing would support the workers who would choose to relocate closer to the\nProject site either permanently or temporarily. Long-term rental of transient and short-term units are\nadditional housing options. The number of workers that would move closer to the Project site is unknown\nbut would not likely be more than 10 percent of the workforce.\n\nRegardless of the actual distribution of the workforce, Project construction would reduce the limited\nsupply of vacant housing units and likely put temporary upward pressure on home values and rental rates,\nwhich would be considered a negative socioeconomic effect; however, housing availability would likely\nreturn to pre-construction levels once the construction is complete. If an estimated 10 percent of the\nworkforce relocated to either Lyon or Mineral counties, the impact would be on the order of a 6-percent\nreduction in vacancy, which would be minor. If 20 percent relocated, vacancies would be reduced by 11\npercent. Impacts to transient lodging could be similar or greater. The localized impacts in terms of\ndemand on rental and transient housing would likely be greater in areas of Yerington versus further\nlocations within Lyon and Mineral counties.\n\nThe impact of construction worker influx on housing would be reduced through development of a\nWorkforce Housing and Transportation Plan, which would identify the housing options for workers and\ncould include new options such as recreational vehicles that could add transient housing options to relieve\nhousing pressures. With the implementation of the Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan, impacts\nwould be reduced, but a potential adverse impact to housing could still occur.\n\n**Access to Local Emergency Services.** The BLM and local emergency services would have emergency\naccess to the Project site via a locked gate to facilitate response time for wildfire and non-wildfire\nincidents. Emergency services may be required in the event of a worker accident or injury, hazardous\nmaterial spill, or wildfire ignition. As discussed in Section _3.17: Public Health and Safety_ , US 95, and\nUS 95A as well as SR 339 and SR 208 are designated as major evacuation routes in the area and would\nalso be used by Project employees and emergency service providers in the event of an emergency.\nWestern Solar Plan PDF HMW1-1 requires preparation of an Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency\nAction Plan would identify evacuation routes for construction personnel during an emergency,\ncommunication protocols, and notifications. Per MM SOC-1, the Applicant would work with Nevada\nCopper to develop an emergency access cooperative agreement to address access to the north of the solar\nsite through the mine\u2019s private property during construction (and O&M) in the event of an emergency and\nevacuation through Reese River Road is not possible. This option has been discussed with Nevada\nCopper and determined feasible (Nevada Copper 2023). Evacuation could also include airlift, as needed.\nPer MM SOC-3, the Project Applicant would be required to coordinate with Mineral and Lyon counties,\nincluding Mineral County Fire Department and the Mason Valley Fire Protection District or other\nresponsible fire authority to determine increased demands for fire protection. A cooperative service\nagreement would also need to be established with the entities, if the entities determine it is necessary. The\n\n\n-----\n\nagreement may include an added fee based on the likely point of service and estimated increases in\nservice needs during construction.\n\nA Fire Prevention and Safety Plan/Management Plan would be implemented for the life of the Project to\nreduce fire risks. During Project construction, aboveground water trucks would be kept on site in the\nevent of a small human-caused fire. The BLM may implement fire restrictions during Project construction\nto reduce the risk of human-caused fires during periods of high fire danger; however, fire risks are low in\nthe Project area due to limited fuel (i.e., vegetation). All wildland fires would be reported to the BLM via\nthe Lyon County Emergency Sheriff\u2019s Communications Division or local 911 emergency services.\n\nThe estimated number of jobs needed for the construction phase is 1,155 persons (again noting this value\nis the total number of jobs while at any one time the average number of workers expected on site is\nestimated to be around 400), equivalent to 1.9 percent of the combined populations of Lyon and Mineral\ncounties. Presumably, the Project would increase the demand for law enforcement, fire protection, and\nemergency medical services by at least a 1.9 percent proportion on average across the two-county region\nand perhaps higher for individual communities and neighborhoods. To mitigate these effects, prior to\nconstruction, per MM SOC-2, the Applicant would be required to coordinate with Mineral and Lyon\ncounties to determine increased demands for fire protection, law enforcement, and emergency medical\nservices through a Cooperative Service Agreement with the counties. The agreement may include an\nadded fee based on likely point of service and estimated increases in service needs.\n\n**Property Values.** The solar site is not located in proximity nor is it visible from any homes and thus is\nnot expected to have any impact on property values. In specific reference to transmission lines, the\nWestern Solar Plan cites several studies attempting to measure the impact of transmission lines on\nproperty values; however, the results have been inconclusive. The PEIS finds that \u201cperception\u201d and\n\u201cnegative imagery\u201d are often temporary, especially at times associated with announcements related to\nspecific project phases. Construction of the Project would be temporary and last approximately 16\nmonths. Only a few homes are located near the gen-tie, including in an area just north of US 95A within\napproximately 0.5 mile, and one home is at the northern extent of the gen-tie, before the gen-tie line\ncrosses the Walker River.\n\n**Social Impacts.** Construction of the Project would have short-term beneficial contributions to the local\nand regional economy. Workers would support local businesses in the city of Yerington and other\ncommunities during construction along worker commute routes. While only 8.7 percent of the\nconstruction workers would be sourced from Lyon County, including the city of Yerington, the increased\nlocal employment would improve residents\u2019 standard of living. Construction would generate traffic that\ncould be perceived as an inconvenience. The city of Yerington, however, has developed around heavy\nindustrial mining and agriculture, which has involved industrial traffic. Adverse social impacts are not\nanticipated.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\n\n**Employment and Income.** Project O&M would require an average of 15 permanent highly compensated\nemployees on an annual basis for 30 years. The increase in permanent jobs would reduce unemployment\nin Mineral and Lyon counties. The Project would require recurring maintenance, security, and other\ninvestments during O&M. The ongoing activities at the Project site would generate annually recurring\neconomic effects. The total annual economic output from the Project operations would be approximately\n$19.3 million in the seven-county area. The effects on the seven-county regional economy as a result of\nthe construction of the Project would be beneficial. Table 3.14-6 presents the Project\u2019s total annual\noperational impacts in the seven-county area.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.14-6** **Total Annual Operational Impacts, 2022 Dollars (thousands)**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Type impact|Labor incomes|Intermediate expenditures|Other property income|Taxes on production|Total output|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Direct|$1,911|$7,663|$3,717|$1,885|$15,176|\n|Indirect|$717|$1,722|$766|$280|$3,485|\n|Induced|$125|$259|$191|$69|$644|\n|Total|$2,753|$9,644|$4,674|$2,234|$19,305|\n\n\n**Tourism and Recreation-Related Economic Impacts.** Similar to Project construction, effects to tourism\nand recreation-related economic inputs during O&M would be driven by the change in visual setting from\nan undeveloped area to a solar facility. The Project would not be expected to induce a substantial loss of\nrecreation and tourism and associated economic loss, given the focus and availability of recreation in the\nMason Valley. No adverse effects to tourism and recreation-related economic inputs from Project O&M\nwould occur.\n\n**Housing and Property Values.** Project O&M would require an average of 15 permanent employees on\nan annual basis for 30 years, which would not have adverse impacts on housing. Given no homes are near\nthe solar site, no impacts to property values are expected, as discussed under Construction.\n\n**Access to Local Emergency Services.** The BLM and emergency responders would have access to the\nProject site via a locked gated. Project O&M would pose a low risk of fires due to the majority of\nmaterials within the solar arrays being non-combustible. The Project BESS would include individual\nbatteries within climate-controlled enclosures that undergo thermal propagation tests and comply with the\nlatest codes and standards for accident conditions and fire safety. A Fire Prevention and Safety Plan/\nManagement Plan would be implemented for Project O&M. MM SOC-1 would also apply to O&M\nregarding an agreement with Nevada Copper for emergency access during the O&M phase. Vegetation\naround buildings and equipment would be maintained, and fire protection systems would be included for\nthe administration/O&M building. The Mineral County Fire Department and the Mason Valley Fire\nProtection District would provide firefighting services for non-wildfire emergencies at the Project site.\nFencing and controlled access gates would provide security for the Project site and would minimize the\nneed for police services.\n\n**Social Impacts.** Project O&M would require on average 15 permanent employees. The influx of\napproximately 15 workers would not adversely contribute to local or regional economies. Workers would\nlikely commute daily from nearby communities or relocate to the Project area. If workers were to relocate\ninto the analysis area, there would be a minor increase in support for local businesses. Employees living\nin the analysis area may require social services; however, approximately 15 permanent employees would\nbe accommodated by existing social services, and new or additional social services would not be required.\nThe solar site is remote and thus not expected to have much impact on social values and characteristics of\nYerington, as previously discussed under Construction.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nAt the end of the Project\u2019s 30-year life, decommissioning would require an expenditure having economic\nimpacts, just as impacts would occur from constructing and operating the Project. The workforce and\nlength of time required for decommissioning activities is expected to be less than that for the construction\nperiod. Although it is difficult to forecast employment conditions 30 or more years into the future,\naccording to growth projections, it is expected that the available labor pool would be greater than under\nexisting conditions. Decommissioning is expected to temporarily decrease unemployment in the Project\narea, similar to construction. The effects on regional employment from decommissioning of the Project\nwould be beneficial. Economic output would be beneficial during decommissioning; however, after\n\n\n-----\n\ndecommissioning, the jobs associated with O&M would be lost. No new impacts to housing or public\nservices would occur.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\n\nCumulative impacts associated with socioeconomics could occur within the region due to construction or\nO&M schedule overlaps, which would require a large construction workforce and temporary housing.\nCumulative impacts largely stem from the potential for increased mining activity as well as additional\nsolar and transmission projects in various planning phases. The Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine Expansion\nis not expected to start construction of their pit mining operations until after mid-2026, once the\nconstruction of the Project is complete. Other solar generation and transmission projects have been\nproposed in the region and are under review and consideration and would not likely have overlapping\nconstruction schedules since these projects have not even commenced NEPA review. The exception\nwould be the 60 MW Luning Solar 2 project, approximately 50 miles away from the Libra Solar site,\nalong Highway 95 near Mineral City, which may be developed before the construction of Libra begins.\nDepending on if and when those solar facilities are actually developed, the cumulative impacts would\neither be sequential or additive. Operationally, and as with the Project, these projects would generate\nincremental tax revenue available for mitigating additive impacts, in each of the respective counties\n(including Lyon, Mineral, Esmerelda, Nye, and others) and the region as a whole through possible\ncooperative agreements.\n\nCumulative impacts could occur to the various community services from increased mining operations or\nother projects and construction of the Project. Additional law enforcement personnel may be required to\nrespond to the needs of a temporary expansion of the workforce. Fire and emergency medical services\ndepartments would likely see an increase in calls, which would increase their level of activity and\nassociated costs. Cumulative projects that bring additional transient and permanent workers to the area\nmay also increase costs and demands, notably, with most of the increase being in Lyon County. Local and\nregional roads would accrue additional traffic to accommodate the transient workforce needed. Housing\ndemand within the area would also increase and cumulative impacts on housing would be expected. A\nWorkforce Housing and Transportation Plan, per MM SOC-2, would allow the Applicant to plan\nconstruction housing needs and identify options that could alleviate the Project\u2019s contribution to housing\nimpacts. Adverse effects, however, could still occur. Cumulative impacts to transportation could also\noccur, given the location of cumulative projects in Lyon County. All projects could potentially utilize the\nsame regional transportation networks. The Project\u2019s Workforce Transportation and Housing Plan would\npotentially reduce the Project\u2019s contribution to cumulative impacts although impacts could remain\nadverse.\n\nThe combined economic activity would correspondingly increase tax revenues during operation of the\nprojects. Personal property tax on Project equipment alone would roughly double Mineral County\u2019s\nbudget on average over the Project\u2019s lifespan. General funds revenues support law enforcement and other\nservices. Sales tax revenues would accrue to both counties (Lyon and Mineral) based not only on direct\nspending but on indirect and induced spending from Project construction and O&M as well as mining and\nother sectors of the economy that may expand. Cumulative projects would likewise create tax revenue\nincreases for Lyon and Mineral counties. Cumulative impacts would include an increased number of jobs\nand demand for workers in the region, which may result in a combined positive impact. Worker shortages\nmay also result in increased wages due to increased labor demand but also slower construction timelines\nfor projects, or workers commuting from further away.\n\n**_3.14.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nConstruction under Alternative 1 is anticipated to take additional time (18 months versus 16 months),\nwhich would temporarily increase the length of time that housing and services would be needed in the\narea. The same PDFs, the CRMP SOPs, MMs, and required management plans as identified for the\nProposed Action would be implemented for this alternative to minimize adverse effects. These include the\npreparation and implementation of a Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan to identify the housing\noptions for workers, as well as a cooperative service agreement with Mineral and Lyon counties, and an\n\n\n-----\n\nadded fee based on service needs. The additional construction timeframes under Alternative 1 would also\nbring beneficial effects to the area including extended employment opportunities and increased indirect\nand induced labor spending. O&M impacts and decommissioning impacts would be the same as described\nunder the Proposed Action. Cumulative impacts would also cause potential increased impacts to\ntemporary housing and services due to the increased construction schedule, which may overlap longer\nwith other projects. PDFs, CRMP SOPs, MMs, and required management plans would reduce effects\nrelated to services and housing, but potential adverse cumulative impacts could still occur.\n\n**_3.14.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nUnder Alternative 2, utilizing supplemental access routes to the Project solar site would have similar\nimpacts to socioeconomics as the Proposed Action. The solar site and other component construction,\nworkforce, and schedule would be the same. The additional access route could reduce traffic along East\nWalker Road that is used to access a tourism and recreational area (Walker River State Recreation Area).\nNo new or greater impacts would occur from diverting some traffic along other routes to the Project site.\nThe same PDFs, MMs, and required plans would apply to reduce adverse effects as identified for the\nProposed Action. Cumulative impacts to employment, income, tourism and recreation, housing, access to\nlocal emergency services, property values, and social impacts would be the same as for the Proposed\nAction.\n\n**_3.14.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\nAlternative 3 would eliminate construction of the proposed 24.1-mile gen-tie line and replace it with a\n0.54-mile-long gen-tie and switching station located under the Greenlink West line. No new or greater\nsocioeconomic impacts would occur from Alternative 3. The same PDFs, MMs and required plans would\napply to reduce adverse effects as identified for the Proposed Action. Cumulative impacts to employment,\nincome, tourism and recreation, housing, access to local emergency services, property values, and social\nimpacts would be the same as under the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.14.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nThe Project would not be constructed under the No Action alternative. No socioeconomic impacts would\noccur; however, the economic benefits the Project could bring to the seven-county region also would not\noccur.\n\n**_3.14.4.7 Relevant Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP Standard_**\n**_Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nPDFs from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project would comply with the\nfollowing PDFs to minimize socioeconomic impacts:\n\n-  S1-1\n\n-  HMW 1-1\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nSOPs from the CRMP (BLM 2001) are listed in Appendix B. The following SOPs were identified as\nrelevant to socioeconomics:\n\n-  Recreation SOP 2\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans, required by the BLM ROW grant, would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize socioeconomic impacts:\n\n-  Emergency Action Plan\n\n-  Fire Prevention and Safety Plan/ Management Plan\n\n-  Traffic Management Plan\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts on\nsocioeconomics:\n\n**MM SOC -1: Nevada Copper Cooperative Agreement**\n\nThe Applicant shall develop a cooperative agreement with Nevada Copper regarding construction and\nO&M emergency only access in the event of an emergency that requires ingress or egress of the Project\nsolar site, and Reese River Road cannot be used.\n\n**MM SOC-2: Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan**\n\nThe Applicant shall prepare a Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan, which shall identify the\nhousing options for workers and include new options such as recreational vehicles that could add transient\nhousing to relieve housing pressures. Alternative transportation options including carpooling, park-andride, bus, shuttle, and other forms shall be included.\n\n**MM SOC-3: Cooperative Services Agreement**\n\nPrior to the NTP, the Applicant shall coordinate with both Mineral and Lyon counties, including the\nMineral County Fire Department and the Mason Valley Fire Protection District or other responsible fire\nauthority, to determine increased demands for fire protection, law enforcement, and emergency medical\nservices during construction and shall establish a Cooperative Services Agreements with both counties, if\ndetermined necessary by both counties. The responsible fire authority shall be determined. An added fee\nto each entity based on the likely point of service and estimated increases in service needs for the\nconstruction of the Project shall be determined, if needed. The increase in service would likely be due to\nincreased workers travel in Lyon County, increased emergency medical services from worker injury\neither on the job or traveling to the job, and increased fire risks at the Project site.\n\n**_3.14.4.8 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nAn irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources refers to impacts on or losses to resources that\ncannot be recovered or reversed. There are no irreversible or irretrievable impacts that would affect\nsocioeconomic conditions. Residual effects are those effects that remain after mitigation has been applied.\nResidual economic effects in relation to housing and services during the construction phase and\ndecommissioning phase could remain under the Proposed Action, even after application of mitigation.\nUntil the Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan is developed, it is assumed that impacts would still\noccur to housing and transportation given the large number of workers needed for construction of the\nProject.\n\n##### 3.15  Environmental Justice\n\n**3.15.1 Introduction**\nThis section analyzes the impacts of the Project on environmental justice (EJ) communities in the vicinity\nof the Project Area. Consistent with Executive Order (EO) 12898 Federal Actions To Address\nEnvironmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations (EOP 1994) and EO 14096\nRevitalizing Our Nation's Commitment to Environmental Justice for All EOP 2023), this section\nidentifies and analyzes the potential for adverse health or environmental effects, including those related to\nclimate change and cumulative impacts, on EJ communities as they are defined by the BLM (BLM 2022).\n\n**3.15.2 Analysis Area**\nThe analysis area for impacts to EJ communities is a 6-mile radius around the Project area and cities and\ncensus designated places (CDPs) within a 55-mile radius of the Project area, including the Walker River\nIndian Reservation and the city of Yerington (shown in Figure 3.15-1). Due to data availability,\ndemographic data for census tracts that fall partially or wholly within the 6-mile proximity radius and\nYerington have been used for this analysis. The 55-mile analysis area conservatively represents the\ndensely populated communities that could experience construction impacts due to temporary worker\n\n\n-----\n\ncommute trips, hauling of construction equipment or debris, and permanent impacts due to operational\nworker commute trips. Due to the broad range of communities within the 55-mile-radius area, including\nurban, suburban, and rural communities, the analysis for the 55-mile-radius communities and Walker\nRiver Indian Reservation uses the state of Nevada, as a whole, as the geographic reference area.\n\nThe 6-mile proximity analysis area is intended to account for low-density and rural settings proximate to\nthe Project solar site that could experience construction or decommissioning impacts similar to those\nwithin the 55-mile analysis area as well as other construction, O&M, and decommissioning impacts\nassociated with dust, noise, air quality, and aesthetics. This analysis uses non-metropolitan Nevada as the\nreference area. [9] The EJ analysis includes communities within Mineral, Lyon, Washoe, Storey, Churchill,\nand Douglas counties, Nevada, as well as Carson City, Nevada. [10] Approximately 37 cities and CDPs are\nwithin 55 miles of the Project area, including, but not limited to, Yerington, Schurz, Fallon, Carson City,\nWadsworth, the Reno Metropolitan area, and the Walker River Indian Reservation. Within Yerington and\n6 miles of the Project area, seven census tracts were identified for analysis: 9602.03, 9602.06, 9608.01,\n9608.02, 9609.01, 9609.02, and 9708.\n\n**3.15.3 Affected Environment**\nThe purpose of the EJ analysis is to identify EJ communities within the analysis area and determine\nwhether they would be disproportionately impacted by adverse effects of Project activities. An EJ\ncommunity is an area of geographic concentration of people who are low income (EJ low-income) or of\npeople considered to be racial minorities (EJ minority). An EJ minority community is identified by the\nBLM as one in which the percentage of minority persons is 50 percent or greater than that of the reference\narea (threshold analysis) or meets or exceeds 110 percent of the reference area's minority percentage\n(meaningfully greater analysis). An EJ low-income community is identified as one in which the\npercentage of people living at or below 200 percent of the poverty line is 50 percent or greater than that of\nthe reference area (threshold analysis) or is equal to or greater than that of the reference area (low-income\nthreshold analysis) (BLM 2022). An EJ tribal/indigenous community is identified as one in which the\npercentage of the population who are members of a state or federally recognized tribe, or who identify as\nAmerican Indian or Native Alaskan, Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander, is equal to or greater than that of the\nreference population. EJ communities in the analysis area are identified in Table 3.15-1 and Table 3.15-2.\nThe following communities within the 55-mile-radius area were identified as EJ low-income communities\nof concern: Fallon, Hawthorne, Mina, Nixon, Schurz, Silver Springs, Stagecoach, Stateline, Sun Valley,\nTopaz Ranch Estates, Wadsworth, Walker Lake, Walker River Indian Reservation, Zephyr Cove,\nWabuska, and Luning. The following census tracts within the 6-mile-proximity area were identified as EJ\nlow-income communities of concern: 9602.03, 9602.06, 9608.01, 9609.01, 9609.02, and 9708.00. One of\nthese, Census Tract 9609.01, encompasses the center of Yerington. Two of these, Census Tract 9608.01,\nand Census Tract 9609.02, are located just west and north of the city of Yerington, respectively. Figure\n3.15-2 shows the EJ low-income communities of concern within the analysis area. The following\ncommunities within the 55-mile-radius analysis area were identified as EJ minority communities of\nconcern: Nixon, Schurz, Stateline, Sun Valley, Wadsworth, Wabuska, and Luning. Census tracts 9609.01,\n9609.02 and 9708.00 within the 6-mile-proximity analysis area and Yerington were identified as EJ\nminority communities of concern. Figure 3.15-3 shows the EJ minority communities of concern within\nthe analysis area.\n\nThe following communities within the 55-mile-radius analysis area were identified as EJ tribal/indigenous\ncommunities of concern: Carson City, Dayton, Fallon, Fernley, Hawthorne, Mina, Nixon, Schurz,\nSkyland, Sparks, Stagecoach, Sun Valley, Topaz Lake, Topaz Ranch Estates, Virginia City, Wadsworth,\nWalker River Indian Reservation, Yerington, Zephyr Cove, Salt Wells, and Luning. Census tracts\n\n9 Demographic data for non-metropolitan Nevada was calculated by omitting the data from Clark County, Washoe\nCounty, and Carson City from Nevada county-level data provided by the U.S Census Bureau.\n10 Carson City is an independent city that Is not incorporated into any county.\n\n\n-----\n\n9609.01, 9609.02 and 9708 within the 6-mile-proximity analysis area and Yerington were identified as EJ\ntribal communities of concern. Figure 3.15-4 shows the EJ tribal/indigenous communities of concern\nwithin the analysis area. The distances of all EJ communities from the Project site and proposed gen-tie\nalignment are provided in Table 3.15-3.\n\n**Figure 3.15-1 Environmental Justice Analysis Area**\n\nSource : (U.S. Census Bureau 2022;

City of Yerington and immediate vicinity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.15.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.15.4.1 Methods_**\nThe EJ analysis identifies EJ communities in the analysis area and assesses potential disproportionate\nadverse effects. According to the CEQ\u2019s Environmental Justice Guidance Under NEPA, agencies should\nconsider the composition of the affected area to determine whether minority populations or low-income\npopulations are present in the area affected by the Project and, if so, whether those human health or\nenvironmental effects may be adverse and disproportionately high (CEQ 1997). Additional details on the\nmethods of analysis and specific effects related to these resource topics are provided in the Libra Solar\nEnvironmental Justice Report (Panorama 2023).\n\nThe BLM provided opportunities for affected communities to be meaningfully involved in the NEPA\nprocess during scoping. Flyers in English and Spanish were publicly posted at four separate locations in\nin the Yerington area, including the BLM Carson City District Office, the Lyon County Library, the\nMineral County Public Library, and the Schurz Tribal Community Center, during the Project\u2019s 30-day\npublic scoping period after release of the NOI. Paper copies of the NOI and Project information were\nmade available and included directions of where and how to comment, and to inform the public of the\nadditional translation services available upon request. The BLM hosted a virtual public scoping meeting\nfor the Project to solicit feedback from attendees.\n\n**_Proposed Action_**\n\n**Overview**\nAny Project-related impacts could disproportionately affect vulnerable low-income, minority, and\ntribal/indigenous EJ communities of concern identified in the analysis area. Western Solar Plan PDFs,\nCRMP SOPs for these resource areas are presented in Appendix B and Project-specific MMs are\npresented in Appendix C of this Draft EIS. The relevant required management plans are listed in the POD\nand resource topic sections.\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Summary.** Adverse effects on the physical environment or human quality of life could be\ndisproportionately higher for EJ communities of concern within proximity to the Project site, particularly\nalong commuter and delivery truck routes, and within communities where Project construction workers\nmight be housed temporarily. These populations may be more sensitive and vulnerable to impacts than the\ngeneral population due to economic and health conditions, including housing costs and availability, and\nhealth care. Death rates for heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, accidents, stroke,\ndiabetes, and other causes are all statistically significantly higher in Lyon County and Mineral County\nthan the State rate. Mineral County also ranks lowest for county health in Nevada (South Lyon Medical\nCenter 2022a) (South Lyon Medical Center 2022a). Impacts to housing, transportation, and health may\noccur to these populations, as described in the following analysis.\n\n**Housing.** The Project would employ approximately 1,155 workers during construction. The number of\nworkers that would emigrate within Mineral and Lyon counties is unknown but would not likely be more\nthan 10 percent of the workforce (or an estimated 115 people). An estimated 26,394 housing units are\navailable in Lyon and Mineral counties, with approximately 1,941 vacant. Project impacts to housing\ninventories would be on the order of a 6-percent reduction in vacancies over a two-county regional area\n(Triple Point 2022). However, localized pressure on the housing rental market and demand for short-term\nhousing is expected to be greater within and near the city of Yerington, where EJ communities of concern\nwere identified and could be more sensitive to the impacts than the general population due to lower\nincomes and limited housing stocks. CDPs within the 55-mile radius area identified as low-income\ncommunities of concern, including Fallon, Silver Springs, and Stagecoach, may also see increased\npressures on short-term housing supplies, which could put upward pressure on rental rates. EJ\ntribal/indigenous communities of concern residing within Silver Springs, Fallon, Wabuska, the city of\nYerington and Census Tract 9609.01, and to the east of the city of Yerington, within Census Tract\n9609.02, may also experience increased pressures on short-term rental housing supplies, which could put\n\n\n-----\n\nupward pressure on rental rates. The Applicant would be required to prepare a Workforce Housing and\nTransportation Plan under MM SOC-2 to anticipate housing needs for transient workers and identify\noptions to reduce the Project\u2019s adverse effects on housing availability and affordability. Even with\nmitigation, adverse, disproportionate effects to EJ communities of concern could still occur.\n\n**Economic Conditions.** The temporary construction workforce would increase the demand for services\nnear the Project area and commuter routes, including law enforcement, fire protection services,\nemergency medical services, and health care. This increase in demand could place additional pressure on\nthese services, adversely affecting service ratios to EJ communities of concern in the Project area,\nincluding Luning, Wabuska, Hawthorne, Mina, Fallon, the city of Yerington and Census Tract 9609.01,\nand Census Tract 9609.02. The Applicant would be required to prepare a cooperative service agreement,\nper MM SOC-3, with Lyon and Mineral counties that includes an added fee based on likely point of\nservice and estimated increases in service needs, to reduce effects.\n\n**Ecological and Cultural Conditions.** The Project would alter an area of natural habitat that contains two\nvegetation types associated with Bailey\u2019s greasewood, the dominant vegetation cover within the Project\narea. Bailey\u2019s greasewood is less common than other on-site vegetation types, and little information\nregarding the distribution and extent of Bailey's greasewood is available. However, unlike the more\ncommon greasewood ( _Sarcobatus vermiculatus_ ), whose flowers are edible and which plant has been used\nin weaving objects and fashioning scrapers, arrow points, and digging sticks, limited evidence exists to\nsupport the use of Bailey's greasewood by Native American tribal groups (NPS 2022). Therefore, the\nvegetation loss from construction would not constitute a disproportionate adverse effect to tribal\ncommunities of concern. During Class III surveys, few pre-historic and Paleoindian archaeological sites\nwere found. Solar array blocks and other components were removed from the design in the area of these\nresources to avoid impacts (see Section _3.5 Cultural Resources_ ).\n\n**Public Health and Social Conditions \u2013 Solar Site.** The closest EJ community of concern to the solar site\nis the Walker River Indian Reservation with its boundary located approximately 3.1 miles to the east of\nthe Project site and 0.1 mile north of the gen-tie line. Within the Reservation, EJ communities of concern\nwere also identified in Schurz CDP, approximately 8.1 miles east of the solar site. The Project\nconstruction would not be visible from the Schurz and communities along US 95 due to the Wassuk\nMountain Range's intervening location. Fugitive dust generated during construction is not anticipated to\naffect the Schurz CDP community, which could otherwise be more vulnerable given health conditions\nmore prevalent in these EJ population. Due to the extensive intervening distance and topography between\nthe Schurz and the Project area, which are in different air basins, disproportionate effects would not\noccur. EJ communities of concern were also identified within Census Tract 9609.02, in the Wabuska CDP\njust north of Yerington, approximately 8.4 miles north of the solar site, and within Census Tract 9608.01.\nThese communities, while also are potentially more vulnerable than the general population to air impacts,\nare not within the viewshed of the Project and would not be disproportionately affected by fugitive dust\ndue to distance, intervening topography, and the use of dust control measures. Views in the background\ndistance zone are possible from Yerington and Census Tract 9609.01, but the distance of 10 miles or more\nminimizes visual contrast and, therefore, visual impacts.\n\n**Public Health and Social Conditions \u2013 Gen-tie.** The closest EJ community of concern to the gen-tie\nalignment and access road is Census Tract 9609.02, with the closest residence located 0.5-mile west.\nPotential adverse effects on local air quality from combustion and fugitive dust emissions could occur.\nThe Project would implement measures through the implementation of a Dust Control and Air Quality\nPlan during construction, which would reduce emissions and concentrations of particulate matter below\nfederal and State air quality standards for all criteria. Adverse impacts related to views of the gen-tie line\nand fugitive dust emissions during construction would occur over small geographic regions over short\nperiods in time and would not be adverse with implementation of Western Solar Plan PDFs and MMs.\n\n**Public Health and Social Conditions \u2013 Transportation Routes.** The EJ communities of concern\nidentified in or near the city of Yerington; Schurz CDP; Wabuska CDP, Fallon CDP, Silver Springs CDP,\nand Stagecoach CDP could experience disproportionate adverse impacts related to temporary\nconstruction-generated traffic along US 95, US 95A, and US 50. Identified rural, low-density EJ\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunities of concern within Census Tract 9708; Census Tract 9608.01; and Census Tract 9609.02; as\nwell as Yerington within Census Tract 9609.01 may also experience disproportionate impacts from\nconstruction-generated traffic (along with noise and dust impacts in proximity to the solar site). These EJ\ncommunities of concern may be particularly vulnerable to the impact due to proximity to the roadway.\nMost workers are expected to commute from Carson City, Fallon, Mina, and Luning to the Project area.\nFigure 3.15-5 shows the anticipated construction worker commute. Measurable impacts related to dust\nwould not be expected along any of the above-mentioned paved roadways since commuters would use\npaved highways. Project construction would temporarily increase vehicle trips on highways and local\nroads near or within these EJ communities of concern. Potential disproportionate and adverse impacts\ninclude increased commute times from traffic delays, wear and tear on local roads, and increased service\nratios at gas stations, food establishments, or other community resources.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\n**Housing.** The Project would create up to 15 long-term, full-time-equivalent high-paying O&M jobs,\nmostly for workers located in the Lyon and Mineral County region. Some of the permanent positions\ncould be filled by migrating workers; however, due to the small number of permanent workers needed\nduring O&M, no disproportionate housing affects are expected to EJ communities of concern in the\nProject area. Due to the Project site\u2019s remote location, the solar facility is not expected to impact\nneighboring property values of EJ communities of concern; however, residences are in proximity to the\nproposed gen-tie alignment. The Western Solar Plan confirms there is very little research into and no\nevidence of solar facilities impacting local property values (BLM and U.S. DOE 2012).\n\n**Economics.** The Project is not anticipated to result in a negative economic impact during Project O&M.\nProject O&M would require an average of 15 locally employed workers. In the event that all 15 workers\n\nrelocate to the Project area, the population increase would not be substantial enough to affect service\nratios.\n\n**Ecological and Cultural.** Potential ecological and cultural impacts from O&M of the Project would\nremain the same as or be reduced compared with the construction phase. No new disturbance footprint\nwould be required, and therefore, O&M is not expected to result in impacts to previously undiscovered\narchaeological resources. The Project would maintain access along Old State Road 2C through the solar\nsite, which could be utilized to access the Pistone-Black Mountain NCA, a site of cultural importance to\nTribes in the region, including the Walker Paiute Tribe; however, the terrain is too rough to access via\nvehicle.\n\n**Public Health and Social Conditions.** Project O&M would not result in new ground disturbance, and the\nnumber of workers on site would not surpass approximately 15 daily. Similar to construction, adverse\nimpacts related to air quality or visual resources would be minor. Disproportionate adverse impacts\nrelated to human health and social conditions affecting EJ communities of concern are not anticipated.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nDecommissioning is expected to have similar impacts as construction, with a similar workforce size and\nduration of work. The influx of workers is anticipated to be similar to that for the construction phase and\nwould not result in disproportionate adverse effects to EJ communities of concern due to the short\nduration (less than 2 years) of decommissioning activities; however, localized pressure on short-term\nrental housing would be greater in Yerington and the immediate vicinity, where some of the EJ\ncommunities of concern were identified. Communities identified as EJ low-income communities of\nconcern such as Fallon, Silver Springs, and Stagecoach may also experience increased pressures on shortterm rental housing supplies, which could put upward pressure on rental rates.\n\nProject decommissioning would increase the number of vehicle trips on highways and local roadways,\nwhich could result in similar impacts to those for construction, including increased commute times from\ntraffic delays, wear and tear on local roads, and increased service ratios at gas stations, food\nestablishments, or other community resources such as health care. EJ communities of concern could\nexperience disproportionate adverse impacts to human quality of life from construction worker travel.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.15-5 Commuter Routes during Proposed Project Construction**\n\nSource: (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 2012; Tele Atlas\nNorth America, Inc. 2018; Esri 2018; U.S. Census Bureau 2022)\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the uncertainty in predicting local socioeconomic conditions 30 years into the future, predicting\nadverse effects to EJ communities of concern during decommissioning is difficult. MMs SOC-2 and MM\nSOC-3 would require a Housing Workforce and Transportation Plan and a cooperative services\nagreement with the counties to reduce potential adverse effects in response to analysis of conditions at the\ntime of decommissioning.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nCumulative impacts to EJ communities could occur within the analysis area from construction or O&M\nschedule overlaps that would require a large workforce to be accommodated. Cumulative impacts largely\nstem from the potential for increased mining activity as well as additional solar and transmission projects\nin various planning phases. The Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine Expansion is not expected to start\nconstruction until after mid-2026, following the construction phase of the Project. Other solar facilities\nand transmission projects have been proposed in the region and are under review. Some of the projects are\nproposing near-term schedules (e.g., Greenlink West); however, the majority of the solar development\nprojects have not even entered environmental review, and construction periods are therefore not expected\nto overlap. The 60 MW Luning Solar 2 project, approximately 50 miles along Highway 95 in Mineral\nCounty was approved in December 2021 and may be built within the next year, prior to the construction\nof Libra. Depending on if and when those solar facilities are actually developed, the cumulative impacts\nwould either be sequential or additive. In O&M, the Project would not contribute a cumulatively\nconsiderable adverse impact to EJ communities of concern related to housing, traffic, air quality and dust,\nor visual resources given few to no impacts associated with O&M. The solar site would also be located\nwithin an area that is consistent with VRM Class IV, which allows for major visual changes.\n\nCumulative adverse impacts from construction and decommissioning would include potential adverse\nimpacts to EJ communities from pressure on the rental housing market, increased service ratios, including\nto emergency response and health care services, air quality and fugitive dust impacts, and traffic impacts.\nThe Project\u2019s Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan, per MM SOC-2, would require the Applicant\nto plan construction housing needs and identify options that could alleviate the Project\u2019s contribution to\nadverse housing impacts. Alternative transportation options including vanpooling, park-and-ride, bus,\nshuttle, and other forms of transportation would also be included. The Applicant would also be required to\nprepare a cooperative service agreement, under MM SOC-3, with Lyon and Mineral counties that\nincludes an added fee based on likely point of service and estimated increases in service needs. Other\nsolar projects may require similar plans, but adverse cumulative effects are still likely to occur that could\ndisproportionately affect EJ communities. The Project would also implement Western Solar Plan PDFs\nand the CRMP SOPs during construction to reduce potential impacts to air quality and from traffic that\ncould affect EJ communities of concern, a considerable contribution to overall cumulative effects could\nstill occur.\n\n**_3.15.4.2 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nConstruction of the Project under Alternative 1 is anticipated to take additional time (18 months versus\n16 months), which would increase the duration of impacts to housing, traffic, and services. Similarly,\ndecommissioning under Alternative 1 is also anticipated to take additional time. The same PDFs, CRMP\nSOPs, MMs, and required plans as identified for the Proposed Action would be implemented for\nAlternative 1 to minimize adverse effects. These include, under MM SOC-2 and MM SOC-3, the\nWorkforce Housing and Transportation Plan to identify the housing options for workers as well as a\ncooperative service agreement with counties and an added fee based on service needs. O&M impacts\nwould be the same as under the Proposed Action. Cumulative adverse impacts to housing, services, and\ntraffic could increase due to the increased construction schedule, which may overlap longer with other\nprojects. PDFs, MMs, and required plans would reduce these effects, but potential adverse cumulative\nimpacts could still occur.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.15.4.3 Alternative 2 \u2013 Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nUtilizing supplemental access routes to the Project solar site would have similar impacts to EJ\ncommunities of concern as the Proposed Action. The proposed construction area, workforce, and schedule\nwould be the same. No new or greater impacts would occur from diverting some traffic along other routes\nto the Project site because no new EJ communities of concern would be adversely impacted. The\nadditional routes still require traffic to travel through Yerington or along US 95A and would not change\nthe location from which workers originate. The same PDFs, MMs, and required management plans would\napply to reduce adverse effects as identified for the Proposed Action. Cumulative impacts to EJ\ncommunities of concern would be the same as for the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.15.4.4 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\nAlternative 3 would eliminate construction of the proposed 24.1-mile gen-tie line and replace it with a\n0.54-mile-long gen-tie and switching station located under the Greenlink West line. No new or greater\nadverse impacts to EJ communities of concern would occur under this alternative. Impacts associated\nwith the 24.1-mile-long gen-tie in Lyon County would be eliminated, including potential generation of\ndust near residences along the alignment. The Project under this alternative would remove gen-tie\nconstruction activities entirely from Lyon County, which would result in reduced impacts to certain EJ\ncommunities. The same PDFs, MMs, and required management plans would apply to reduce adverse\neffects as identified for the Proposed Action; however, since the solar site construction would be the same\nunder this alternative as the Proposed Action, impacts would be similar and potentially adverse.\nCumulative impacts to EJ communities of concern would, thus, be similar to those for the Proposed\nAction.\n\n**_3.15.4.5 No Action Alternative_**\nThe Project would not be constructed under the No Action alternative. No impacts to EJ communities of\nconcern would occur.\n\n**_3.15.4.6 Relevant Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP Standard_**\n**_Operation Procedures, Management Plans, Design Features and Mitigation_**\n**_Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nAll of the Western Solar Plan PDFs that would apply to the Project are listed in Appendix B. The Project\nwould comply with the following PDFs to minimize impacts to EJ communities:\n\n-  EJ1-1\n\n-  HMW1-1\n\n-  T2-1\n\n-  AQC1-1, AQC2-1, AQC3-1, and AQC4-1\n\n-  VR1-1, VR2-1, VR2-2, VR2-3, VR2-4, VR3-1\u00b8 VR4-1\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nAll of the SOPs from the CRMP (BLM 2001) that would apply to the Project are listed in Appendix B.\nThe following SOPs would minimize impacts to EJ communities:\n\n-  Common to All SOP 2\n\n-  Soil, Watershed, and Air SOPs 1, 2 and 4\n\n-  Visual Resource Management SOPs 2 and 3\n\n-  Rights-of-Way Corridors SOPs 4 and 5\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans, required by the BLM ROW grant, would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize impacts to EJ communities:\n\n-  Fire Prevention and Safety Plan/Management Plan\n\n\n-----\n\n-  Dust Control and Air Quality Plan (Draft available on the project website)\n\n-  Traffic Management Plan\n\n-  Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan (Draft available on the project website)\n\n-  Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan\n\n-  Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan\n\n-  Lighting Management Plan (Draft outline available on the project website)\n\nThe Project would comply with mitigation measures MM SOC-2 and MM SOC-3 from Section 3.14\nSocioeconomics to minimize adverse impacts on EJ communities.\n\n**_3.15.4.7 Irreversible or Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nAn irreversible or irretrievable effect resources refers to impacts on or losses to resources that cannot be\nrecovered or reversed. There are no irreversible or irretrievable impacts that would affect EJ communities\nof concern. Residual effects are those effects that remain after mitigation has been applied. Some\ndisproportionate and adverse residual effects in relation to housing, economic, and environmental impacts\nto EJ communities during the construction phase and decommissioning phase could persist. Residual\neffects from impacts to recreational access due to increases in traffic from construction and long-term\nimpacts to wildlife and vegetation could also result in disproportionate adverse effects to EJ communities\nof concern.\n\n##### 3.16 Public Health and Safety\n\n**3.16.1 Introduction**\nThis section addresses public health and safety topics related to the construction, O&M, and\ndecommissioning of the Project. This section is based on the Public Health and Safety Report (Panorama\n2023), which also includes a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment by McGinley & Associates\n(McGinley 2023). Health and safety topics addressed include:\n\n-  Occupational health and safety\n\n-  Public health and safety\n\n-  Electric and magnetic fields (EMFs)\n\n-  Hazardous wastes and materials\n\n-  Solid waste management\n\n-  Emergency response\n\n-  Intentionally destructive acts\n\n-  Fire\n\n**3.16.2 Analysis Area**\nThe analysis area for impacts on public health and safety is the Project site (i.e., solar site, gen-tie\nalignment, and access road) under the Proposed Action and alternatives. Existing adverse public health\nand safety conditions could coincide with the Project. The term hazardous materials refer to both\nhazardous substances and hazardous wastes. The analysis area is limited to a buffer of 1 mile around of\nthe Project area, as any accidental release would be localized and would not disperse farther than 1 mile\nfrom the Project site or off-site components. The area of analysis for emergency response includes the\nProject area within Mineral County as well as access roads within Lyon County and the city of Yerington.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.16.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.16.3.1 Occupational Safety_**\nMost of the occupational hazards associated with solar energy projects are similar to those of heavy\nconstruction associated with power-generating facilities. These occupational considerations include\nphysical hazards associated with equipment and machinery use, construction operations, working at\nheights, electrical hazards, lightning, fire, exposure to weather extremes, harmful interactions with plants\nand animals, and exposure to hazardous substances. At solar power generation and transmission facilities,\ninduced current and electrical arcing pose a potential occupational hazard.\n\n**_3.16.3.2 Public Health and Safety_**\n**Exposed Populations and Sensitive Receptors.** Sensitive receptors are population types that are at\ngreater risk from exposure to hazardous materials or emitted pollutants. Sensitive receptors include the\nvery young, the elderly, and those with existing health conditions. No sensitive receptors are in the\nvicinity of the Project solar site. The closest sensitive receptor to the solar site is a residence located near\nthe Walker River State Recreation Area southwest of the city of Yerington, approximately 5 miles west of\nthe solar site. Additional residences are located farther west and northwest, approximately 8.5 miles from\nthe proposed solar site, within and scattered in the outskirts of the city of Yerington.\n\nThe closest sensitive receptors to the proposed gen-tie alignment are located 0.5 mile to the west, just east\nof the city of Yerington, near US Route 95A. The Walker River Reservation is approximately 3.6 miles\neast of the proposed solar site and immediately east of the northeastern extent of the proposed gen-tie\nalignment. The sensitive receptors within the Walker River Reservation are in Schurz, approximately\n8 miles east of the Project solar site.\n\n**Existing Public Health and Safety Conditions.** Statistics related to the public health and safety\nconditions of Mineral and Lyon counties\u2019 residents were obtained through the Nevada Health Response\nOffice of Analytics. Mineral and Lyon counties have a higher mortality rate [11] from heart disease, cancer,\nchronic lower respiratory disease, influenza and pneumonia, and diabetes than the U.S. average (NDHSS\n2019a; 2019b; NVSS 2019). Existing conditions related to public health and safety in proximity to a\nproposed site are commonly considered as baseline conditions for evaluating potential health and safety\nimpacts, including the risk for increased rates of respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma), cancer, and heart\ndisease. However, public health and safety conditions were not considered in the analysis area as no\nhuman communities are located within 1 mile of the solar site.\n\n**Vector-Borne Diseases.** Blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks can transmit viruses\nwhen they bite susceptible humans and animals. Four main virus agents of encephalitis are found in the\nU.S., all of which are transmitted by mosquitoes: eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis,\nSt. Louis encephalitis, and La Cross encephalitis. West Nile Virus (WNV) and Zika virus are related to\nthe St. Louis virus and cause similar symptoms. Most human infections are asymptomatic or result in\nnonspecific flu-like symptoms, but infection may also lead to encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain,\nwith a fatal outcome or permanent neurologic damage in a small portion of infected persons. Occurrences\nof West Nile virus and Zika in Mineral and Lyon counties are very low, and the risk to public health from\nthese vector-borne diseases is extremely low. In 2021, Mineral County had no confirmed cases of any\nvector-borne diseases, and Lyon County had 1 confirmed case of WNV (Sepcic 2022).\n\n**Valley Fever.** Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as valley fever, is primarily a disease of the lungs\nthat is common in the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico. Valley fever is caused when\nsusceptible people and animals inhale spores of the fungus coccidioides, which grows in soils in areas of\nlow rainfall, high summer temperatures, and moderate winter temperatures. The spores become airborne\nwhen the soil is disturbed by winds, construction, farming, and other activities. People working in certain\noccupations who are exposed to disturbed soils are at greater risk of infection. Valley fever is not\n\n11 Data reflect causes of deaths that occurred between 2015 and 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\ncontagious, and most cases are very mild; about 60 percent or more of infected people never seek medical\nattention. However, extreme cases can cause death, usually among patients with compromised immune\nsystems. More than 4 million people live in areas where valley fever fungus is prevalent in the soils.\nIn 2021, Mineral County had no confirmed cases of Valley Fever and Lyon County had 1 confirmed case\nof Valley Fever (Sepcic 2022).\n\n**_3.16.3.3 Electric and Magnetic Fields_**\nElectromagnetic Fields (EMFs) are created whenever power lines are energized. The strength of the field\ndepends directly on the voltage of the line creating it, and the field attenuates rapidly with increasing\ndistance from the source. Electric fields are reduced in many locations because they are effectively\nshielded by objects or materials such as trees or houses and distorted by any object that is within the\nelectric field, including the human body. Like electric fields, magnetic fields from power lines are created\nwhenever current flows through them at any voltage, the strength of the field is directly dependent on the\nvoltage of the current, and the field strength attenuates rapidly with distance from the source. However,\nunlike electric fields, magnetic fields penetrate almost everything and are unimpeded by buildings, trees,\npeople, or other obstacles. The Project region contains several high-voltage transmission lines in\nestablished energy corridors. EMFs are commonly at background levels approximately 300 feet from a\nsource (California EMF Program 2022).\n\n**_3.16.3.4 Hazardous Materials and Wastes_**\nProject construction would involve the use of hazardous materials typical of most types of construction,\n(e.g., fuels, oils, adhesives, solvents, pesticides). Under federal and State laws, any material, including\nwastes, may be considered hazardous if it is specifically listed by statute as such or if it is toxic, ignitable,\ncorrosive, or reactive. If improperly managed, hazardous materials can cause public health hazards when\nreleased to the soil, groundwater, or air. The Libra Solar Project Health and Safety Report provides the\nregulatory environment as it relates to hazardous wastes and materials (Panorama 2023).\n\nA Phase I Environmental Site Assessment was prepared for the Project by McGinley & Associates\n(McGinley 2023). The Phase I ESA did not identify any recognized environmental conditions (RECs), [12]\ncontrolled recognized environmental conditions (CRECs), [13] known spills or uncontrolled releases of\nhazardous materials or wastes, or oil or gas wells within the Project area. An underground storage tank\nand State Hazardous Waste Site, as well as multiple mineral oil spills, were identified at the Fort\nChurchill substation through a database search. Multiple soil excavations and remediations, as well as\nwater testing, have been conducted at the Fort Churchill substation to the satisfaction of NDEP.\n\n**_3.16.3.5 Solid Waste Management_**\nThe closest operating landfill with the potential to serve the Project is the Hawthorne Landfill, located\napproximately 28 miles southeast of the Project solar site. This Class IV landfill primarily serves Mineral\nCounty and has a permitted disposal capacity of 1,249,000 cubic yards (NDEP 2002). Other landfills,\nincluding the Carson City Landfill and the Lockwood Regional Landfill, all have confirmed capacity for\nsolid waste collection (NDEP 2017; 2018; 2009).\n\n**_3.16.3.6 Emergency Evacuation_**\nThe Project area has designated major evacuation routes in the event of a large-scale evacuation: Hwy 95\nNorth towards Fernley, US 95A north towards Silver Springs, US 95A east towards Schurz, SR 339\ntowards Smith, and State Route 208 towards the 95A (NDOT 2022).\n\n12 The term REC means the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on,\nor, at a property due to any release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or\nunder conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment.\n\n13 A CREC is an REC that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority with\nhazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required\ncontrols.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.16.3.7 Intentionally Destructive Acts_**\nThe Project site is in an undeveloped desert area away from populations and infrastructure where\nintentionally destructive acts could be anticipated. Where it is possible to estimate event probabilities for\nindustrial hazards, collisions, and natural disasters using historical statistical data and information, it is\nnot possible to accurately estimate the probability of an act of terrorism or sabotage. Therefore, the\ndiscussion on potential effects regarding intentionally destructive acts is focused on the consequences of\nsabotage or a terrorist attack on a solar facility. Such consequences would be expected to be similar to\nthose for an industrial accident or natural disaster that could result in an interruption of power service,\nfire, or hazardous materials release.\n\n**_3.16.3.8 Fire Risk and Protection_**\nData modeled using the Nevada Division of Forestry's Natural Resources and Fire Information Portal\n(NDF 2022) classifies the wildfire risk on the Project solar site and in the immediately surrounding area\nas \"very very low\" to \"very low\". However, northeast of the city of Yerington and Fort Churchill\nGenerating Station, a segment of the gen-tie alignment is within an area of \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cextreme\u201d fire\nrisk (Nevada WRA 2021). Nine wildfires were documented within 10 miles of the Project site (including\nthe gen-tie and access roads). Two were attributed to natural causes, three were of unknown cause, and\nless than half were attributed to human-caused ignition sources. None of the ignition points occurred\nwithin the Project site. The closest ignition point was approximately 3 miles south of the proposed gen-tie\nconnection into the Fort Churchill Substation, just north of the city of Yerington. The closest ignition\npoint to the Project solar site was approximately 8 miles southwest along the Walker River east of\nCambridge Hills (NIFC 2023).\n\nThe BLM is responsible for responding to wildfires on BLM-managed public land. However, the BLM is\nnot responsible for responding to fires that are not considered wildfires. Fires not considered wildfires\n(e.g., structural fires, hazardous materials fires) would be responded to by the local jurisdiction. The\nproposed Project would fall within the jurisdiction of the Mineral County Fire Department for the Project\nsolar site and the Mason Valley Fire Protection District for the majority of the gen-tie line, which services\nthe city of Yerington and greater Mason Valley. The closest Mineral County Fire Department station is in\nSchurz, approximately 8.1 miles east of the Project solar site. The closest Mason Valley Fire Protection\nDistrict station is in Yerington, approximately 11.1 miles northwest of the Project solar site on SR 208.\n\n**3.16.4 Environmental Consequences**\n\n**_3.16.4.1 Methods_**\nThis analysis was conducted through publicly available data accessed by GIS mapping tools, Project data\nprovided by the Applicant, and an on-site assessment of existing environmental conditions.\n\n**_3.16.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Occupational Safety.** Occupational hazards during construction of the Project would include heat stress\nor stroke, exposure to hazardous materials, electric shock, and accidents or injuries. Occupational hazards\nwould be minimized with the implementation of BMPs, safety standards, and the use of appropriate\nprotective equipment as required under law, including all federal Occupational Safety Health\nAdministration (OSHA) and Nevada-OSHA requirements. Employees would be trained in monitoring,\nproper notification, and containment following a hazardous materials release as detailed in the SPCCP, as\nrequired by law. However, as adverse effects to workers could still occur, preparation of a Hazardous\nMaterials and Waste Management Plan would be required as part of the BLM ROW grant.\n\nWestern Solar Plan PDF HMW1-1 requires the preparation and implementation of a Hazardous Materials\nand Waste Management Plan that outlines the training of personnel on all appropriate OSHA and Nevada\nOSHA guidelines. The CRMP SOP 23 (Common to All) requires compliance with State standards for\npublic health and safety, environmental protection and siting, construction, and O&M when those\nstandards are more stringent than federal standards. Adverse effects from construction-related\n\n\n-----\n\noccupational hazards would be minimized through the implementation of the Western Solar Plan PDF and\nthe CRMP SOP.\n\n**Public Health and Safety** . Unintentional ponding and the use of above-ground water tanks for fire\nprotection could result in breeding opportunities for mosquitoes and an increased risk of WNV and Zika.\nImplementation of the Health and Safety Program, SPCCP, and SWPPP, covering the water tanks, and\nimplementing a PUP, if needed to control mosquitoes, would reduce the potential for mosquito breeding\nand consequently the risk of WNV and Zika. With these measures, the Project would not increase the risk\nof vector-borne disease or bring WNV and Zika to the area.\n\nThe occurrence of valley fever in Mineral and Lyon counties, caused by inhaling coccidioides fungal\nspores, is very low. Fugitive dust generated during construction and decommissioning could expose\nworkers to spores that may be present in these desert soils. Using water and the BLM-approved dust\npalliatives to control fugitive dust during construction would minimize the potential for the Project to\nincrease human exposure to the coccidioides fungal spores. With these controls in place, the Project\nwould not have an adverse impact on the occurrence of valley fever in the area. Analysis of dust emission\nand numerous minimization measures are presented in Section _3.3 Air Quality and Climate Change_ .\n\n**Electric and Magnetic Fields.** EMFs impacts are related to energized lines and therefore there would be\nno EMF-associated construction impacts.\n\n**Hazardous Wastes and Materials.** Constructing the Project would require the routine transportation,\nuse, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes typical of construction projects that could result in\naccidental releases. None of the chemicals proposed for use or storage at the Project site are on the list of\nregulated substances in 40 CFR section 68.130. Implementing the Health and Safety Program, SPCCP,\nand SWPPP, as recommended in the Public Health and Safety Report (Panorama 2023), and the CRMP\nSOP 2 and SOP 3 (Hazardous Waste) would reduce the likelihood of, and minimize the potential adverse\neffects from, accidental releases.\n\n**Solid Waste Management.** Project construction would generate approximately 1,515 tons of scrap metal,\nwood, glass, plastic, and worker-generated waste, per the POD. Construction debris would be managed\nand processed in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Western Solar Plan PDF\nHMW1-1(a) requires identifying and minimizing the waste stream during construction of the Project and\nestablishing regular removal of waste. The Health and Safety Program would include a Waste and\nHazardous Materials Management Plan that would identify the anticipated waste streams, give handling\ninstructions for waste streams, including damaged or old batteries and panel waste, and describe how the\nwastes would be managed in accordance with BLM policy, and federal, state, and local laws. The Waste\nand Hazardous Materials Management Plan would be approved by the BLM in accordance with the\nCRMP SOP 8 (Common to All). The Hawthorne Landfill, the Carson City Municipal Landfill, or the\nLockwood Regional Landfill all have adequate capacity to accommodate the Project\u2019s waste disposal\nwithout impacting the waste disposal needs of the local communities. Any specialty wastes, such as solar\npanels or battery storage, would be taken to specialty locations for recycling or disposal (see PDF\nHMW1-1[b]). No adverse effects related to solid waste management are anticipated.\n\n**Emergency Response.** The gen-tie construction may require short-term closure of the US 95A. US 95A\nis designated as a major evacuation route in the area (NDOT 2022). Any temporary closures of US 95A\nassociated with the Project would be coordinated with NDOT. Encroachment permits and authorizations\nwould be obtained prior to any work within the US 95A ROW. With proper coordination and\nimplementation of encroachment permit requirements, adverse effects to emergency response would not\noccur. Local roads to the Project site are unlikely to be used as emergency routes because of the remote\nlocation of the Project site.\n\nEvacuation of numerous construction workers and Project personnel from the Project area may be needed\nin the event of a major emergency. Given limited access to the site, primarily along East Walker Road to\nReese River Road, evacuation could be difficult if these roads were blocked. A Site Evacuation Plan\nwould be prepared to address evacuation, in accordance with OSHA (29 CFR \u00a7 1910.38(a)), as a part of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Health and Safety Program that would be approved by the BLM prior to authorization of Project\nconstruction through the NTP. The Evacuation Plan would address other methods of evacuation, such as\nalong access roads heading north towards Pursel Lane (through agreements with Nevada Copper, per MM\nSOC-1), shelter-in-place provisions, and air evacuation provisions. Preparation and implementation of a\nSite Evacuation Plan would minimize adverse effects related to emergency evacuation of on-site Project\npersonnel.\n\n**Intentionally Destructive Acts.** Site security would include fencing and possibly motion sensor lighting,\non-site security guards, cameras, and other technology during construction and O&M. Perimeter security\nfencing would be 7 feet in height (inclusive of 6 feet of fencing with 1 foot of barbed wire at the top). The\nentire site would be fenced appropriately to restrict public access during construction and O&M. Chainlink security fencing would be installed around the site perimeter, substation, and other areas requiring\ncontrolled access. Implementation of security fencing would reduce the risk of exposure to individuals\nduring construction-related activities.\n\n**Fire Risk and Protection.** Project construction and O&M could increase fire risk through vehicles and\nequipment operating within vegetated areas, smoking, battery failures, transmission lines, and\nintroduction of annual grasses that would increase the fuel load. A wildfire originating in the Project area\nduring construction could damage or destroy the partially built solar facility or the surrounding\ntransmission facilities, decrease air quality, cause hazardous materials releases, interrupt nearby\nrecreational uses, spread fire to lands outside the Project area, destroy forage and cover, or cause injury or\ndeath of personnel on the site. Indirect impacts would result in changes to the vegetation communities and\nthe wildlife supported by these communities. The risk of a wildfire spreading outside the Project area as a\nresult of construction would be low based on the wildfire risk assessment ratings and vegetation\ncharacteristics in the Project area and based on past occurrences of wildfires in most of the Project area\n(Nevada WRA 2021a; 2021b; 2021c; NIFC 2023).\n\nWestern Solar Plan PDF WF1-1 requires the implementation of fire management measures that identify\nand minimize fire risk, such as providing worker training to all Project personnel prior to their entering\nthe Project work site. Western Solar Plan PDF WF1-1 also requires inspection and monitoring measures\nto reduce fire risk during construction, O&M, and decommissioning of a solar energy development.\nWestern Solar Plan PDF WF2-1 would also be implemented, which further reduces on-site fire risks by\nrequiring passive and active vegetation management to minimize the potential to increase the frequency\nof wildland fires and prevent the establishment of non-native, invasive species on the solar energy facility\nand its transmission line and roads. While Western Solar Plan PDFs WF1-1 and WF2-1 would reduce the\nfire risk from the Project, they do not require a comprehensive plan to review and address all fire risks\nduring construction. Thus, Project MM PHS-1 is recommended and requires preparation and\nimplementation of a Fire Prevention and Safety Plan to minimize adverse effects associated with\nincreased fire hazards during construction.\n\nTo address the counties\u2019 ability to provide the needed additional services, Project MM SOC-3 would\nrequire coordination with Mineral and Lyon counties, including the Mineral County Fire Department and\nthe Mason Valley Fire Protection District or other responsible fire authority, prior to issuance of a NTP\nfor the Project by the BLM, to determine increased demands for fire protection and establish a\ncooperative service agreement with the entities that may include an added fee based on likely point of\nservice and estimated increases in service needs during construction. With implementation of Western\nSolar Plan PDFs WF-1 and WF2-1 and MMs PHS-1 and MM SOC-3, the Project would not result in\nadverse effects from an increase in the risk of wildfire.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\n**Occupational Safety.** Occupational hazards during O&M would be similar to those identified for\nconstruction; however, fewer workers would be involved in O&M than with construction.\nImplementation of Western Solar Plan PDFs HMW1-1, HMW2-1, and HMW3-1, the CRMP SOP 23\n(Common to All), an SPCCP, and compliance with OSHA and Nevada OSHA regulations would\nminimize potential occupational hazards during operation and maintenance activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Public Health and Safety.** The effect of the Project operations on vector-borne diseases and valley fever\nin the area would be less than the effect due to construction because, during O&M, there is less water use\nfor dust abatement, less opportunity for mosquitoes to breed, and less potential to mobilize airborne dust\nthat could contain fungal spores. By applying the controls discussed under Construction Impacts, the\nProject would not have an adverse effect on public health and safety.\n\n**Electric and Magnetic Fields.** No residences or other uses would be subject to EMF exposure from the\nproposed gen-tie line due to the distance between the gen-tie line and the nearest residence, which is over\n1,000 feet away. Adverse effects to humans from EMF exposure are not anticipated.\n\n**Hazardous Wastes and Materials.** Project O&M would require the routine transportation, use, and\ndisposal of hazardous materials and wastes similar to those used for construction, as well as spent\nbatteries, transformer fluids, and pesticides used to control mosquitoes. Limited use of herbicides would\noccur to control non-native and noxious weeds. If herbicides or pesticides are required, they would be\nlimited to those analyzed and approved by the BLM in the 2007 Vegetation Treatments Using Herbicide\non BLM Lands in the 17 Western States PEIS (BLM 2007) and the 2016 Final Vegetation Treatments\nUsing Aminopyralid, Fluroxypyr, and Rimsulfuron on BLM Lands in 17 Western States PEIS (BLM\n2016). To be consistent with those PEISs, herbicide use would adhere to applicable PDFs contain therein.\nThe process for treatments would be characterized in a PUP, approved by the BLM. Accidental release of\npesticides, hazardous materials, or waste could affect public health or the environment. The batteries used\nfor the solar facility would most likely be lithium-ion, which are not considered hazardous waste but must\nbe managed and recycled properly to prevent combustion and fire hazards. Numerous regulations ensure\nthe safe transport, use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials. Hazardous materials accidents or\nspills could still occur. Requirements of the SPCCP would be implemented for transformers and other oilcontaining structures.\n\nRequirements of Western Solar Plan PDFs HMW1-1, HMW2-1, and HMW3-1, including the Hazardous\nMaterials and Waste Management Plan, would ensure that personnel are properly trained in the handling\nof identified chemicals and wastes and instructed in the procedures to follow in case of a chemical spill or\naccidental release. Western Solar Plan PDF HMW3-1 would require maintaining compliance with the\nterms and conditions for hazardous materials and waste management during O&M by measures such as\ninstalling sensors or other devices to monitor system integrity and implementing robust site inspection\nand repair procedures. Implementation of these measures would minimize adverse effects associated with\naccidental hazardous materials release.\n\nAlthough solar panels for utility-scale facilities would most likely use nonhazardous silicon-based\nsemiconductor material, it is possible that some solar panels may use semiconductors containing heavy\nmetals such as cadmium, selenium, and arsenic. These metals are fully contained within the solar panels\nand would not be released under normal operating conditions (BLM and DOE 2012).The Project includes\nbattery storage on site to help store the energy produced by the panels so the energy can be released at\noptimal times. The type of battery is not yet determined, but would likely be lithium ion. Lithium-ionbased batteries include industry-standard design features to greatly reduce the potential of a spill or leak.\n\n**Solid Waste Management.** The Project would produce wastes commonly associated with solar facility\nO&M activities. These wastes would include defective or broken electrical materials, empty containers,\nthe typical refuse generated by workers and small office operations, and other miscellaneous solid wastes.\nThe existing landfills in the area have adequate capacity to accommodate the Project waste without\nadversely impacting the local waste disposal needs. To ensure that wastes would be disposed of in\naccordance with laws, HMW1-1 requires preparation and implementation of a Hazardous Materials and\nWaste Management Plan prior to operation to minimize potential effects.\n\n**Emergency Response.** The O&M of the Project would neither cause any road closures nor impair access\nto local roads. Internal access roads to the solar site would be designed to meet the Mineral and Lyon\ncounties' fire codes. O&M of the Project would not result in any adverse effects on emergency response\nactivities. The Health and Safety Program would include a Site Evacuation Plan to evacuate on-site\n\n\n-----\n\nworkers in the event of an emergency, per PEIS PDF HS1-1(b). With these measures in place, the Project\nwould not adversely affect emergency response protocols.\n\n**Intentionally Destructive Acts.** The consequences of an intentionally destructive act on the facility\nduring O&M would be similar to those that might occur during construction, with the added risk of an\ninterruption of electrical service to end users. The Project includes security measures such as security\nfencing, controlled access gates, on-site security patrols, lighting, electronic and security systems and/or\nremote monitoring. Once the Project is constructed, non-emergency access would be limited. The\npotential release of hazardous materials used at the facility due to an attack during O&M would not cause\na threat to the health and safety of the surrounding community because these materials would be present\nin limited quantities, their toxicity is relatively low, and the site is far from the nearest receptors. The\nProject could be at risk of cyberattacks resulting in data breaches or power loss as reliance on computing\nand remote operations has increased. Based on recent attacks, this is often done through the inverter\ncontrols and monitoring systems. Integration of and consideration for cybersecurity when selecting\nmonitoring and other computing systems for the Project would minimize adverse effects associated with\ncybersecurity attacks that could result in loss of solar power into the grid. Adverse impacts associated\nwith intentional destructive acts during O&M of the Project are unlikely given the security measures\nincluded in the design and the relatively low likelihood of such an action.\n\n**Fire Risk.** The probability of a wildfire occurring due to O&M activities would be low due to the low-\nand low-to-moderate-risk site conditions and the required training of operations staff. Western Solar Plan\nPDF WF1-1 would require the Applicant to incorporate fire management training into the worker training\nfor all phases of the Project\u2019s life including operations. The worker training would ensure the workers are\naware of key fire mitigation efforts of the Project work site during all phases of the Project\u2019s life.\nCompliance with regulations and implementation of PDFs would reduce but not eliminate fire hazard\nrisks from hazardous materials, improper disposal of batteries, and line breakages. MM PHS-1 requires\npreparation and implementation of a comprehensive Fire Prevention and Safety Plan to minimize adverse\neffects associated with increased fire hazards during operations, including requiring a battery-specific fire\nsuppression plan. Implementation of Western Solar Plan PDFs WF1-1 and WF2-1 and of PDFs HMW1-1\nand MM PHS-1 would reduce adverse effects associated with fire hazards during O&M. Western Solar\nPlan HS1-1 requires preparation and implementation of a comprehensive Fire Prevention and Safety Plan\nto minimize adverse effects associated with increased fire hazards during O&M, including requiring a\nbattery-specific fire suppression plan. These measures would reduce adverse effects associated with fire\nhazards during O&M.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\n**Occupational Safety.** Occupational hazards during decommissioning would be similar to those identified\nfor construction. Decommissioning activities would be similar to construction activities and would also\nrequire implementation of Western Solar Plan PDFs HMW 1-1, HMW 2-1, HMW 3-1, HMW 4-1, and\nHMW 5-1 and compliance with OSHA and Nevada OSHA guidelines. Western Solar Plan PDFs HMW\n4-1 and HMW 5-1 would require emergency response capabilities during reclamation and\ndecommissioning, and decommissioning design features, implementation of the Hazardous Materials and\nWaste Management Plan, health, and safety training, and the SPCCP would minimize potential adverse\nhealth and safety impacts to Project personnel.\n\n**Public Health and Safety.** The impacts on public health and safety from decommissioning would be the\nsame as those identified for construction. Controlling breeding opportunities for mosquitoes by covering\nwater tanks, preventing ponding, and using the BLM-approved dust palliatives to reduce fugitive dust\nwould minimize the potential for vector-borne diseases and valley fever.\n\n**Electric and Magnetic Fields.** No EMF impacts are expected from decommissioning.\n\n**Hazardous Waste and Materials.** Decommissioning would require the use of fuel and lubricants for\nvehicles and equipment as well as the transport and disposal of hazardous materials used at the Project\nsite, such as refrigerants, spent solar panels, and electrical equipment. Inadvertent release of hazardous\nmaterials could occur. Compliance with existing laws and regulations and Western Solar Plan PDFs\n\n\n-----\n\nHMW1-1, HMW2-1, HMW3-1, HMW4-1, and HMW5-1 would ensure that the risk of hazards associated\nwith accidents and spills or leaks during decommissioning would be minimized. Although these incidents\ncould still occur, their likelihood is considered low. Adverse impacts associated with any accidental\nrelease of hazardous materials would be minor and localized.\n\n**Solid Waste Management.** Decommissioning would result in the generation of solid waste as facility\ncomponents are disassembled. Solid wastes include concrete, metal, plastics, and photovoltaic panels.\nRecyclable materials would be removed from the waste stream and recycled. The remainder would be\ndisposed of in an approved landfill. Based on current estimates and permits, landfills in the area are\nexpected to be open at the time of decommissioning and would have remaining capacity available.\nTherefore, sufficient capacity is expected to be available to accommodate solid waste generated from\ndecommissioning. Specialty waste, such as solar panels or battery storage systems, would be recycled or\ntaken to specialty waste facilities and would not contribute to the nearby landfill waste unless specifically\nallowed at that time (in 30 years). No adverse effects would occur.\n\n**Emergency Response.** Project decommissioning activities would be similar to construction activities and\nwould not impair implementation of, or physically interfere with, an adopted emergency response plan.\nWestern Solar Plan PDF HMW4-1 requires Project developers to maintain emergency response\ncapabilities throughout the reclamation and decommissioning period for as long as hazardous materials\nand wastes remain on site.\n\n**Intentionally Destructive Acts.** Prior to the facility being taken offline, the probability and effect of\nintentionally destructive acts is similar to that during construction. Once the facility is taken offline, the\nlikelihood of the site being a target of intentionally destructive acts would be reduced since the site would\nno longer operate and produce power, so there would be little incentive to target it.\n\n**Fire Risks.** Potential effects from decommissioning would be similar to those described for construction,\nincluding an increase fire risk through vehicles and equipment operating on vegetated areas, smoking,\nbattery failures, transmission lines, and introduction of annual grasses that would increase the fuel load.\nAs described for construction, with implementation of Western Solar Plan PDFs WF1-1, WF2-1, and MM\nPHS-1 and SOC-1, decommissioning of the Project would not result adverse effects from an increase in\nthe risk of wildfire.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nCumulative impacts related to occupational safety, public health and safety, and EMFs would not be\nexpected to occur since the impacts related to these factors would either be project-specific and not\ncompound or would not be cumulatively adverse given effects of each project would be minimal and/or\nwould not have spatial or temporal overlap.\n\nCumulative effects could occur related to the use, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes. US 95 and\nUS 95A may be used to access many of the cumulative projects and would be used to transport any\npotentially hazardous materials used in construction, O&M, and decommissioning of the cumulative\nprojects; however, most of the other identified cumulative projects would not likely be constructed at the\nsame time as the Project, with the exception of Greenlink West and potentially the 60 MW Luning Solar 2\nproject, in Mineral County, approximately 50 miles away. Ground-disturbing activities could disturb\ncontaminated soils or sites. Improper disposal and handling of contaminated materials, or accidental\nrelease of hazardous materials during handling or transport, could expose the public to health risk. The\nProject would contribute to a potentially adverse cumulative effect. Preparation of a Hazardous Materials\nand Waste Management Plan in accordance with Western Solar Plan PDF HMW1-1 would minimize the\nProject's contribution to a potentially cumulative effect on occupational health and safety and risk of\nhazardous materials accidents or spills. Cumulative projects would be required to comply with existing\nhealth and safety laws and Western Solar Plan PDFs or other BLM BMPs, which would reduce the\nadverse cumulative effects.\n\nCumulative projects would generate hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste during construction and\nO&M that would require disposal; however, construction periods except for that of Greenlink West,\n\n\n-----\n\nLuning Solar 2 and, potentially, the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine Expansion are not anticipated to\noverlap with the Project's construction period. Due to the available capacity of landfills in the region,\ncumulative projects are not anticipated to adversely affect landfill capacity. Each cumulative project\nunder the jurisdiction of the BLM is anticipated to require recycling of materials where feasible and\nadherence to the Western Solar Plan or the BLM BMPs to reduce the cumulative waste.\n\nCumulative projects may also increase demand for and utilize similar roads for emergency response.\nConstruction is not expected to overlap except, potentially, for the Greenlink West project and potentially\nthe Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine Expansion. Emergency response may also be needed during O&M.\nImplementation of Western Solar Plan PDF HMW1-1 requires preparation of an Emergency Response\nPlan. Similar PDFs and SOPs would be expected for other solar projects on BLM lands as well as for\nGreenlink West. While the overall impacts are not known for the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine\nExpansion, the Project would reduce effects through the Emergency Response Plan and thus would not\ncontribute to any adverse cumulative effect.\n\nConstruction and O&M of the adjacent cumulative projects that involve the use of heavy machinery or\noff-road vehicle use would increase the risk of wildfire ignition. Adverse cumulative impacts could occur;\nhowever, wildfire risk in the region of the Project and cumulative projects is low (Nevada WRA 2021b).\nThe Project would involve activities that could spark a fire or change the fire susceptibility, resulting in a\ncontribution to the cumulative regional fire risk. Western Solar Plan MM PHS-1, which requires\npreparation and implementation of a Fire Prevention and Safety Plan, along with implementation of\nWestern Solar Plan PDFs WF1-1 and WF2-1, would further reduce the risks of wildland fires.\nCumulative projects would likely require similar fire prevention plans or adherence to the Western Solar\nPlan PDFs, reducing the cumulative risk of fire.\n\n**_3.16.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nConstruction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts to public health and safety resources\nwould be similar for Alternative 1 as for the Proposed Action because the area of the proposed solar site,\naccess, and workforce would be similar. Alternative 1 may require a two month longer construction\nperiod, slightly increasing impacts. The reduction in vegetation removal and exposed soils through the\nmodified construction methods approach, however, would lessen impacts to air quality from fugitive dust,\nfurther reducing the potential for valley fever infections. Fire risks may be slightly increased by leaving\nmore vegetation. The same PDFs as identified for the Proposed Action would be implemented for\nAlternative 1 to minimize adverse effects.\n\n**_3.16.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\nProviding supplemental access routes to the Project solar site during construction would result in the same\nimpacts to public health and safety as the Proposed Action. No new or greater risks or impacts would\noccur from diverting some traffic along other routes to the solar site. The solar site and gen-tie would be\nconstructed, operated, and decommissioned as described for the Proposed Action. The same PDFs and\nSOPs would apply to reduce adverse effects as identified for the Proposed Action. Cumulative impacts\nwould also be the same as for the Proposed Action. Supplemental routes would only be used during\nconstruction, and cumulative impacts would remain the same as described since use of the supplemental\nroutes would not introduce any new or greater hazards that could contribute to cumulative effects.\n\n**_3.16.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-Tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\nConstruction, O&M, and decommissioning impacts to public health and safety would be reduced for\nAlternative 3 as compared to the Proposed Action because of the elimination of construction of a 0.54miles long gen-tie line in lieu of a 24.1-mile gen-tie. The solar site, access, and amount of construction\nthat could result in impacts, particularly fire risks, would be reduced. The same PDFs and SOPs\napplicable to the Proposed Action would be implemented for Alternative 3. Cumulative impacts would\nalso be reduced since, under this alternative the gen-tie alignment would be reduced by 23.6 miles, which\nwould reduce risks of hazardous materials spills, emergency response needs, and wildfire risks from the\nProject.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.16.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the Project would not be developed, and there would be no hazards or\nrisks introduced to the public. Therefore, there would be no impacts to public health and safety in the\nanalysis area.\n\n**_3.16.4.7 Relevant Required Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, the CRMP_**\n**_Standard Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nProgrammatic design features from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project would\ncomply with the following PDFs to minimize impacts to public health and safety:\n\n-  HMW1-1, HMW2-1, HMW3-1, HMW4-1, and HMW4-2\n\n-  HS1-1\n\n-  WF1-1 and WF2-1\n\n**The CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nSOPs from the CRMP are listed in Appendix B. The following SOPs were identified as relevant:\n\n-  Common to all SOPs 8 23\n\n-  Hazardous Waste SOPs 2 3\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans, required by the BLM ROW grant, would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize impacts to public health and safety:\n\n-  SPCCP\n\n-  Health and Safety Program (including a Fire Prevention and Safety Plan/ Management Plan,\nEmergency Action Plan, Waste and Hazardous Materials Management Plan, and Trash Abatement\nPlan)\n\n-  SWPPP\n\n-  Site Restoration and Revegetation Plan (Draft available on the Project website)\n\n-  Decommissioning and Site Reclamation Plan\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures as well as MM SOC-1 and MM SOC3 from Section 3.14 Socioeconomics to minimize adverse impacts to public health and safety:\n\n**MM PHS-1: Fire Prevention and Safety Plan**\nThe Applicant shall prepare and implement a Fire Prevention and Safety Plan to ensure the safety of\nworkers and the public during Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning activities. The Fire\nPrevention and Safety Plan shall be submitted to the BLM for review and approval prior to the issuance of\nthe NTP. The plan shall incorporate the use of appropriate fire protection equipment, worker training, and\nconsultation with local fire departments to identify appropriate protocols and procedures for fire\nprevention and early response to minor fires. The plan shall also address the following recommendations,\nwith particular focus on suppressants for fires from lithium-ion battery cells, including inert gas, carbon\ndioxide, and Halon as well as measures to protect batteries against thermal abuse:\n\n-  Keep a water truck or other portable trailer-mounted water tank on-site and available to workers at\nall times for use in extinguishing small man-made fires.\n\n-  Use fire watches during hot work on-site (e.g., welding, soldering, cutting, drilling, or grinding).\n\n-  Incorporate the use of appropriate fire protection equipment, worker training, and consultation\nwith local fire departments to identify appropriate protocols and procedures for fire prevention and\nearly response to minor fire. The plan should limit where smoking can occur to minimize chances\nof igniting a fire and should identify proper vehicle maintenance and use to minimize fire risks.\n\n\n-----\n\n-  Store battery packs at reduced state-of-charge [14] prior to and during construction to reduce the\nlikelihood that crush, puncture, or external heating would lead to cell thermal runaway and a fire\nignited by heated cell cases.\n\n-  Ensure protocols are in place to quickly extinguish any transmission line breakages that could\nignite a fire during construction.\n\n-  Immediately report fires to 911 or (702) 631-2350 and make all accommodations to allow\nimmediate safe entry of firefighting apparatus and personnel.\n\n-  Coordinate with the BLM law enforcement or their designated representative to conduct an Origin\nand Cause Investigation on any human-caused fire on the Project site. Properly manage and\npreserve evidence in coordination with the BLM to minimize disturbance of potential evidence\nlocated at the fire scene.\n\n**_3.16.4.8 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nAn irreversible or irretrievable impact would occur if the public or workers were exposed to hazardous\nlevels of waste and materials, significant occupational accidents, EMFs, or wildland fires. Construction,\nO&M, and decommissioning activities would occur in accordance with all applicable laws and\nregulations governing health and safety. Implementation of these standard practices would reduce\npotential occupational health and safety risks. Although the Project would use hazardous materials during\nconstruction, O&M, and decommissioning, it is unlikely that the accidental release of hazardous materials\nwould result in irreversible or irretrievable impact due to the types and quantities of the hazardous\nmaterials used. If an accidental release were to occur, exposure to hazardous materials would be\nminimized by the implementation of the PDFs and the various health and safety plans. There are no\nreasonably foreseeable future actions that would cumulatively increase the risk of public or occupational\nexposure to hazardous materials in the analysis area.\n\nResidual effects on public health and safety related to occupational risk, EMF, hazardous materials,\npublic health, emergency response, and intentionally destructive acts would not be expected after\nimplementation of regulatory requirements and mitigation.\n\n##### 3.17 Transportation and Traffic\n\n**3.17.1 Introduction**\nThis section describes the existing transportation and traffic conditions in the analysis area. This section is\nlimited to non-recreational modes of transportation that would be used for the movement of materials and\nequipment during construction and that would be used by workers for commuting during construction,\nO&M, and decommissioning of the Project. An analysis of Project impacts on recreational access,\nincluding OHV travel, is provided in Section _3.12 Recreation_ .\n\nThe BLM\u2019s regulations are primarily related to travel and transportation management for recreational\npurposes. The BLM Manual 1626 Travel and Transportation Management (BLM 2011b) provides\ndetailed policy, direction, and guidance for the comprehensive management of travel and transportation\non BLM-administered lands and related waters. The BLM also maintains Handbook 9113-1 Roads\nDesign (BLM 2011), which dictates the design standards for roads on BLM-managed lands. Most of the\ntraffic-related Project impacts would occur on non-BLM lands and are thus subject to local and regional\ntransportation policies, as opposed to those established by the BLM. Permitting processes for Lyon and/or\nMineral counties (e.g., the Renewable Energy Special Use Permit for Mineral County) would likely\nrequire the preparation of a county-specific traffic study and Traffic Management Plan prior to\n\n14 _State-of-charge_ refers to percent that the battery is charged.\n\n\n-----\n\nconstruction. The Project\u2019s POD also requires that a Traffic Management Plan be prepared prior to\nconstruction.\n\n**3.17.2 Analysis Area**\nThe analysis area for transportation and traffic includes the transportation systems within the Mason\nValley in Lyon and Mineral counties, Nevada (as shown in Figure 3.17-1) and focuses on the primary\npublic road systems that would be used for construction, O&M, and decommissioning of the Project.\nRegional travel routes anticipated for the Project are shown in Figure 3.17-2. Materials, equipment, and\ncommuter trips may originate outside of the analysis area. Project-related traffic would be dispersed and\nis not expected to impact regional transportation corridors such as Interstate 80 (I-80), State Route 439\n(SR 439), U.S. Highway 50 (US 50), or roads within the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area.\n\nThe travel routes addressed in this analysis include US 95A, Nevada State Route 339 (SR 339), SR 827,\nSR 208, East Walker Road, and Reese River Road (Figure 3.17-3). Project related traffic would utilize US\n95A to SR 339 south to SR 827 east to SR 208 south. From SR 208, Project traffic would turn east on to\nEast Walker Road and then east to Reese River Road. Under Alternative 2, SR 827 and East Pursel lane\nmay be used within Yerington along with unnamed, unpaved transmission line roads. While there are\nmultiple other roads within the Mason Valley, they are not proposed for use as main transportation routes\nfor the Project.\n\n**3.17.3 Affected Environment**\n\n**_3.17.3.1 Regional and Local Roadway Facilities_**\n\n**Project Roadways**\nThe regional roadways that could be impacted by the Project are described below and are shown in Figure\n3.17-1.\n\n-  **US 95A** is a paved, two-lane, arterial highway that traverses undeveloped rural areas, with an\naverage speed limit of 60 mph. US 95A runs east\u2013west from the US 95 junction to Yerington, and\nnorth/south from the US 50 junction at Silver Springs to Yerington. US 95A is maintained by the\nNDOT.\n\n-  **SR 339** is a paved, two-lane, collector highway that runs north-south on the west side of Yerington\nand the Mason Valley. SR 339 extends approximately 11.5 south from the junction of US 95A to\nits junction with SR 208, bypassing the urban and agricultural areas of the greater Yerington area.\nUS 339 is maintained by the NDOT.\n\n-  **SR 827** , also locally referred to as Mason Road, is a paved, two-lane, minor collector road that\nruns east-west from its junction with SR 339 to the west, through the intersection of SR 208, and\nthen turns in to an unpaved road approximately 1.5 miles to the east. The paved portion of SR 827\nis maintained by the NDOT.\n\n-  **SR 208** is a road that extends south from US 95A at the north end of Yerington. Project traffic\nwould utilize SR 208 from the intersection of SR 827, heading south. SR 208 is a mostly straight,\npaved, two-lane, collector highway that traverses an active agricultural area. SR 208 also serves as\nthe main street through downtown Yerington, with a speed limit ranging from 25 mph in the\ndowntown core commercial district to 50 mph south of Yerington. This road is also maintained by\nNDOT.\n\n-  **East Walker Road** turns east approximately 8.2 miles south of the junction of US 95A and SR\n208. East Walker Road is a two-lane unpaved rural road approximately 24 feet wide. The road has\nthree culvert crossings, including one over the East Walker River and two over irrigation ditches.\nTwo houses and agricultural fields are within the first 0.5-mile portion of the road. At the 0.75mile point, the road turns to the southeast into a remote, undeveloped desert landscape. East\nWalker Road is the primary access point to the Walker State Recreation Area, approximately 4.25\nmiles from the intersection of East Walker Road and SR 208. The segment from SR 208 to the\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.17-1 Transportation Corridors in the Proposed Project Area**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.17-2 Transportation Routes to the Proposed Project Site**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.17-3 Local Roadway Access for the Proposed Project**\n\n\n-----\n\nintersection with Reese River Road is 5.9 miles, of which 3.6 is on BLM land and 2.3 miles is on\nLyon County or State-managed lands. All of East Walker Road is maintained by Lyon County.\n\n-  **Reese River Road** traverses east into Mineral County, intersecting the Project solar site\napproximately 5.5 miles east of the intersection with East Walker Road. Reese River Road is an\nunpaved road averaging approximately 15 feet wide. The BLM maintains Reese River Road.\n\nUnder Alternative 2, **East Pursel Lane** , accessed from SR 827 and SR 208, could also be utilized during\nthe construction phase of the Project as a supplemental access route to the Project site, reducing total\ntraffic volumes on East Walker Road. East Pursel Lane is an unpaved private access road owned by\nNevada Copper. The northern route of East Pursel Lane is primarily used by NV Energy to service the\nsubstation to the east of the mine.\n\n**Traffic Counts for Major Roadways**\nNDOT publishes annual traffic count data on their Traffic Records Information Access online GIS\napplication. Annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts are available for SR 339, SR 827, SR 208, and\nUS 95A near the Project area (provided in Table 3.17-1). AADT is not available for East Walker Road,\nReese River Road, or East Pursel Lane.\n\n**Table 3.17-1 Affected Transportation Route Average Daily Traffic Data**\n\n\n\n\n|Road name|Managing entity|AADT (Year 2022) *|\n|---|---|---|\n|SR 208 (Station 0190108, 300ft.

As described in detail below, for potential\nimpacts to traffic volumes, generalized level of service (LOS) indicators from FHWA were used as the\nbaseline (FHWA 2017). LOS defines traffic movement in the context of mobility and roadway design.\nFor comparison to existing AADT estimates and measurements, construction traffic (worker and haul\ntruck) daily round trips were estimated for the Project access roads.\n\nMeetings were conducted with Lyon County and the BLM to discuss design standards for Project roads\nunder their jurisdiction (i.e., East Walker Road and Reese River Road, respectively). These meetings\nindicated transportation facilities should retain existing structural and traffic capacity standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor potential impacts to traffic volumes, generalized LOS indicators from FHWA were used to establish a\nbaseline and define the potential for measurable impacts (FHWA 2017). LOS values define traffic\nmovement in context of user mobility and roadway design and are defined by the following:\n\n-  LOS A = Free-flow traffic with users unaffected by the presence of other users\n\n-  LOS B = Stable traffic flow with a high degree of freedom to select speed but with some influence\nfrom other users\n\n-  LOS C = Restricted flow that remains stable but with significant interactions with others in the\ntraffic stream. The general level of comfort and convenience declines noticeably at this level\n\n-  LOS D = High-density flow in which speed and freedom to maneuver are severely restricted and\ncomfort and convenience have declined even through flow remains stable\n\n-  LOS E = Unstable flow at or near capacity levels with poor levels of comfort and convenience\n\n-  LOS F = Stop and go waves, poor travel times, low comfort and convenience, and increased\naccident exposure\n\nA speed limit of 45 miles-per-hour was used for SR 208, as it is the lowest available estimate in the\nguidance and accounts for slower overall traffic speeds that vary through Yerington and the southern\nroadway portion. A speed limit of 45 mph was used for SR 339 to account for travel through the\nurbanized area as the road intersects with multiple roads connecting to the urbanized Yerington area. The\nspeed limit on SR 827 is 45 mph. A 60 mile-per-hour average speed limit was used for US 95A. For US\n95A, given the baseline AADT, it appears to be at a LOS A. SR 208, SR 339, and SR 827 appear to be\ncurrently operating at a LOS B based on AADT (FHWA 2017). For this analysis, any change in LOS to a\nlower service level represents a potential impact on users. LOS should stay at a D or higher to be\nacceptable. The volumes for LOS A, B, and C for US 95A, SR 208, SR 339, and SR 827 are shown in\nTable 3.17-2.\n\nNo traffic volume data is available for East Walker Road, Reese River Road, or East Pursel Lane.\nAdditionally, the FHWA guidance does not apply to rural unpaved roads. Qualitative analysis is provided\nfor these roads, based on discussions with Lyon County and the BLM.\n\n**_3.17.4.2 Proposed Action_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\n**Roadway Volumes and Level of Service.** The average number of workers anticipated for each\nconstruction phase is shown in the POD; however, the on-site construction workforce is anticipated to\nnumber approximately 400, on average, with a peak of up to approximately 700 workers at any given\ntime. Most construction staff and workers would commute daily to the jobsite from the Reno and Carson\nCity Metropolitan areas (Arevia 2023). Materials would be delivered to the site during construction\nperiodically throughout the day via trucks, typically between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., up to seven days a\nweek (Arevia 2023).\n\nHeavy construction equipment would be moved on site at the beginning of construction and would remain\nthroughout construction, as needed. Daily vehicle traffic would be primarily composed of workers\u2019\npassenger cars/light trucks. For this analysis, the average of 542 worker trips per day was assumed if all\nphases were to occur at the same time. This is likely an overestimate. As shown in Table 3.17-3, total\nconstruction vehicle trips could, conservatively, reach up to 855 trips per day over the 16-month\nconstruction period. Table 3.17-2 describes the daily volume changes to SR 208, SR 339, SR 827, and US\n95A as under the Proposed Action.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3.17-2 Level of Service Volume Comparison**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Road name|AADT (Year 2022)|Volume that starts LOS B|LOS C|Current LOS|Volume increase from Construction traffic|Total volume|LOS with Project|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|US 95A (Station 0190115, .6 mi N of Miller Ln)|4,700|19,000|24,200|A|18%|5,555|A|\n|SR 208 (Station 0190108, 300 ft.

However, for all three roadways, the LOS is not expected to change (from A on US\n95A and from B on SR 208, SR 339, and SR 827). Construction and delivery trucks would arrive at and\ndepart the Project site throughout the day. A total of 313 truck trips on US 95A would result in a 6\npercent traffic volume increase. This increase would not reduce the LOS. The 313 truck trips would result\nin an 8 percent increase on SR 208 and SR 339 and a 24 percent increase on SR 827. The increases for all\nthree roadways would not reduce the LOS.\n\nThe majority of the traffic volume increases would be from commuting workers, as stated above. Most\nconstruction work commences early in the morning, so vehicle trips would likely be during a morning\n\n\n-----\n\ncommute period, or earlier, and an evening commute and could overlap with farm worker and farm\nequipment traffic. Traffic from workers could be concentrated during the peak traffic hours, thus creating\na greater impact to local traffic in Yerington, in particular. Implementation of MM TR-1 would require\nremote parking, ideally in northern Yerington, and a shuttle or vanpool service for a target of 50-percent\nof the workers. Assuming 12-person shuttle vans would be used, the total daily worker vehicle trips\nwould be reduced from an estimated 524 trips each way down to approximately 300 trips each way.\nAdditionally, workers would be scheduled in split shifts, where feasible, to further reduce peak traffic\nvolumes. With the implementation of MM TR-1, adverse effects would be reduced. Additional traffic\nstudies and measures to obtain permits from Lyon County and/or Mineral County may also be required\nand would be obtained prior to construction. Project MM SOC-2 also includes the preparation of a\nWorkforce Housing and Transportation Plan prior to construction, which would address workforce\ntemporary housing nearer to the Project site, scheduling of vehicle trips and shifts, and traffic routing\nmeasures to further reduce traffic impacts. Given the scale of Project construction and the small size of\nYerington, the impacts even with traffic controls could be adverse but would only last for the duration of\nconstruction (16 months).\n\n**Road Safety and Design** _General Safety Impacts._ The Project would generate a large number of worker,\ndelivery, and construction vehicle trips throughout construction. Construction traffic, such as large\ndelivery trucks traveling at low speeds or with extra wide loads, could cause a hazard to other roadway\nusers. Traffic crash data does not indicate a crash risk along the Project access route (NDOT 2020);\nhowever, a Traffic Management Plan is also required. MM TR-2 requires the Traffic Management Plan to\ndictate the use of traffic control measures such as traffic control devices and flaggers during high traffic\nperiods or during deliveries of large or oversized loads, particularly at the intersections of SR 827 and SR\n208 and SR 208 and East Walker Road and along the first 0.5 mile of the road near the homes. Special\nattention would be paid to East Walker Road since traffic for agricultural operations and to the Walker\nRiver State Recreation Area also use the road. Implementation of MM TR-2 would minimize the effects\nof traffic hazards associated with construction. Traffic hazards for each road or system are discussed in\nmore detail in the following sections.\n\n_US 95A._ Large delivery trucks would follow all safety requirements for driving on NDOT highways.\nSafety hazards are also not anticipated for US 95A given trucks would be required to follow NDOT\nrequirements for oversized or hazardous material transport. Installation of the gen-tie line could require\nshort-term closure of US 95A east of Yerington, approximately 0.8 mile from the intersection of Prospect\nStreet. Temporary closures of US 95A would be coordinated with the NDOT. The necessary\nencroachment permits and authorizations would be obtained prior to any work within the US 95A ROW.\nExisting roads are proposed for use where possible, in accordance with Carson City CRMP SOP 4 (Rightof-Way Corridors); however, approximately 16.9 miles of 20-foot-wide spur roads would be required to\naccess each set of gen-tie poles. Adverse effects would not occur with proper coordination and\nimplementation of the requirements of the encroachment permits and the Traffic Management Plan.\n\n_SR 339._ Safety hazards on SR 339 are not anticipated as safety requirements for oversized or hazardous\nmaterial transport on NDOT highways would be followed. Adverse effects would not occur with\nimplementation of MM TR-2, which would include the use of traffic control measures during deliveries\nof large or oversized loads.\n\n_SR 827._ The intersection of SR 827 and SR 208 is a four-way stop. Adverse effects would be minimized\nwith implementation of MM TR-2, requiring traffic control devices and flaggers during periods of high\ntraffic volumes or during deliveries of large or oversized loads.\n\n_SR 208._ Potential safety improvements may be required due to identified partially obstructed views at the\nintersection of SR 208 and East Walker Road. The Applicant would coordinate with Lyon County Roads\nDepartment and NDOT during final design to determine the potential need for intersection modifications\nand the design parameters that may be desired or required, per MM TR-2. Any construction would likely\nrequire a temporary reduction of lanes on SR 208, and traffic control would direct traffic through the area\nduring construction. If determined necessary, safety improvements would be completed prior to\n\n\n-----\n\ncommencement of the Project construction. Impacts to transportation due to construction of a turn lane on\nSR 208 would be reduced with traffic control.\n\n_East Walker Road._ Three culverts are located in the first 0.6-mile segment of East Walker Road from the\nintersection of SR 208. The road is currently rated for truck traffic, and no replacement of the culverts is\nanticipated. East Walker Road has a compacted road surface but is unpaved, and an increase in traffic\nwould increase fugitive dust, posing a potential safety risk due to reduced driver visibility and a health\nrisk to nearby houses, which are considered sensitive receptors. The impacts of dust generation on air\nquality are evaluated in Section _3.3 Air Quality and Climate Change_ . To eliminate the fugitive dust near\nthe sensitive receptors, the POD requires a Dust Control and Air Quality Plan be developed, which would\nalso follow Western Solar Plan PDF AQC2-1. The Project also includes potentially paving approximately\n1.5 miles of East Walker Road from the intersection of SR 208, to be determined in coordination with\nLyon County Roads Department and the homeowners along the road. Additionally, the Applicant would\ndevelop a maintenance agreement for East Walker Road with Lyon County for the 30-year life of the\nProject. All improvements and maintenance activities would follow Lyon County standards and\nspecifications. An increase in traffic on the remaining portion of East Walker Road and Reese River Road\nwould also increase fugitive dust emissions; however, there are no sensitive receptors nearby.\nImplementation of the Dust Control and Air Quality Plan would require dust abatement, thus minimizing\nadverse effects. East Walker Road could also experience damage from the high traffic volumes. MM TR3 requires pre- and post-construction road condition assessments of East Walker Road, and restoration of\nany damage during and after Project construction. Adverse effects would be minimized by requiring\nassessment and repair of any public roads during or after construction, in accordance with mitigation\nmeasures and monitoring.\n\n_Reese River Road._ The existing road base and width of Reese River Road is inadequate and would be\nimproved to safely accommodate construction truck traffic. Reese River Road is maintained by the BLM,\nand all improvements would be completed in accordance with the BLM Manual 9113-1 Roads Design\nHandbook (BLM 2011) and in communication with the CCDO in accordance with Western Solar Plan\nPDF T2-1. Damage from heavy traffic could occur on the road. MM TR-3 requires maintenance of the\nroadway for the life of the Project, commensurate with its use by the Project.\n\n**Emergency Services.** Emergency response vehicles currently using roadway facilities in the Project area\ninclude EMS, County Sheriff, State Highway Patrol, and fire departments. Emergency services would not\nbe interrupted by construction of the Project, and access for emergency service to the Project site would\nalways be provided. Additional emergency access would be available from SR 208 to West Bridge Street\nand East Pursel Lane through the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine property and then south along a BLMmanaged transmission ROW. The Applicant would develop a cooperative agreement with Nevada Copper\nto include emergency access through their property. Adverse effects on emergency services would not\noccur during project construction. Evacuation is addressed in Section _3.16 Human Health and Safety_ .\n\n**Operation and Maintenance Impacts**\nUp to 15 employees are expected to be on site each day during O&M of the Project. Workers would live\noff site but would commute to the Project site daily to conduct security, maintenance, and repairs. O&M\nof the Project site would rarely require vehicles and equipment such as crane trucks, forklifts, manlifts,\nand pick-up trucks; thus, no impacts to traffic LOS or safety are expected. No heavy equipment would be\nused during normal facility operation but may be occasionally needed for maintenance. Traffic impacts\nwould not be adverse from such use. Key public roadways through the Project site (i.e., Reese River\nRoad, Old State Road 2C) would remain open for the life of the Project in accordance with CRMP SOP 5\n(Rights-of-Way Corridors). Effects on transportation resources during operation and maintenance of the\nProject would be less than during construction and would not be adverse.\n\n**Decommissioning Impacts**\nThe workforce and length of time for decommissioning the Project is expected to be similar to or less than\nthat of the construction period. Effects on regional and local roadway operations would be similar to those\nanticipated to occur during construction. Project MMs TR-1 and TR-2 along with the Traffic\n\n\n-----\n\nManagement Plan measures would also apply to decommissioning. Implementation of mitigation\nmeasures and management plans would minimize adverse effects.\n\n**Cumulative Impacts**\nThe Project\u2019s construction activities are not anticipated to overlap in schedule with any of the identified\ncumulative solar development projects. The other identified solar projects are in the very preliminary\nstages of NEPA review with the exception of the Luning Solar projects, one of which is built, and the\nother was approved in 2021 and may be constructed within the next year, prior to Libra\u2019s construction.\nMany of the cumulative solar projects are located north of Yerington, and while they could utilize US\n95A, they would not utilize SR 339, SR 827, or SR 208. The Project would overlap with the construction\nof Greenlink West. Greenlink West would require a much smaller workforce in any one location at a\ngiven time and, as a linear Project, its traffic impacts would move with the project progression. Greenlink\nWest\u2019s workers and deliveries would likely use US 95A but not SR 208 or SR 339. Impacts would\ncompound, but the increase in adverse effects would be limited to the construction overlap period, which\nwould be a few months at most. In preliminary discussions with Nevada Copper, who operates the\nPumpkin Hollow Copper Mine, they do not anticipate starting their future planned expansion (open pit\nmine) during the Project\u2019s proposed construction timeline.\n\nThe Project would have no adverse cumulative effects during O&M due to the very limited worker trips\nrequired. However, the construction of the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Mine Expansion may start soon after\nthe construction of the Project is completed. An adverse cumulative impact could result as the Copper\nMine Expansion would also require heavy traffic loads through Yerington, likely also using SR 208,\nconstituting an extension in the duration of impacts. The Project would implement several MMs and\nmanagement plans during its construction phase to reduce effects, but cumulative effects could be\nadverse. All identified cumulative projects would be completed prior to decommissioning of the Project;\nthus, no other cumulative impacts are anticipated.\n\n**_3.17.4.3 Alternative 1 \u2013 Major Drainage Avoidance and Fenced Corridors with Vegetation_**\n**_and Topography Maintenance_**\n\nConstruction, O&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts to transportation resources, including\nLOS, safety and design, and emergency access would be the same under Alternative 1 as described for the\nProposed Action because the proposed access route and workforce would be very similar. The same PDFs\nand MMs, as well as the same plans including the Traffic Management Plan and Workforce Housing and\nTransportation Plan (MM SOC-3), as identified for the Proposed Action would be implemented for\nAlternative 1 to reduce adverse effects. As under the Proposed Action, some adverse effects to LOS and\nsafety, due to the scale of construction, are expected. This alternative may require larger equipment as\nwell as a longer construction period, extended from 16 to 18 months, which may slightly increase the\nadverse effects as compared with the Proposed Action.\n\n**_3.17.4.4 Alternative 2 \u2013 Alternative Supplemental Access During Construction_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\nAlternative 2 would reduce the traffic volumes on the southern portions of SR 208 and East Walker Road\nby diverting approximately 25 percent of daily traffic to the supplemental access routes identified in\nChapter 2. Vehicles would still need to travel along the northern portions of SR 208 through Yerington\u2019s\ncommercial core. LOS impacts would be similar for the Proposed Action. Use of SR 827 and East Pursel\nLane by approximately 25 percent of the construction worker traffic would require a cooperative\nagreement between the Applicant and Nevada Copper that would outline maintenance responsibilities and\nterms. If the supplemental route off of US 95A were used, impacts along SR 339, SR 827, and SR 208\nwould be reduced. Project MMs TR-1 and TR-2 along with the Traffic Management Plan and Workforce\nHousing and Transportation Plan would still be required to reduce adverse effects. Impacts to LOS and\nsafety would be reduced as compared with the Proposed Action by spreading out the construction traffic\nroutes, but could still be adverse due to the scale of construction and the relatively small size of\nYerington.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Operation and Maintenance, Decommissioning, and Cumulative Impacts**\nO&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts are the same as described for the Proposed Action. The\nalternate routes would not be used during O&M but may be used during decommissioning, in which case\nthe impacts to LOS and safety could be slightly reduced as compared with the Proposed Action for\ndecommissioning.\n\n**_3.17.4.5 Alternative 3 \u2013 Alternative Gen-Tie Connecting to Greenlink West_**\n\n**Construction Impacts**\nAlternative 3 would reduce the amount of workforce needed to construct the Project due to elimination of\nthe 24.1-mile-long gen-tie line and thus use of US 95A to access the unpaved roads in the vicinity of the\ngen-tie. This alternative could result in an approximate 30-percent reduction in daily worker and truck\ntrips as compared to the Proposed Action. The LOS impacts would otherwise be similar to those\ndescribed for the Proposed Action, and the same PDFs, MMs, and the Traffic Management Plan and\nWorkforce Housing and Transportation Plan would apply under this alternative. Traffic safety and design\nand emergency access impacts would also be similar to that described for the Proposed Action. With\nimplementation of the same PDFs, SOPs, MMs, and management plans described for the Proposed\nAction, adverse impacts would be reduced and less than those for the Proposed Action.\n\n**Operation and Maintenance, Decommissioning, and Cumulative Impacts**\nO&M, decommissioning, and cumulative impacts to transportation resources would be slightly reduced\nfor Alternative 3 as compared with the Proposed Action because the workforce would be reduced. US\n95A would not be impacted by the gen-tie crossing it, and decommissioning would take less time. The\nsame PDFs, SOPs, MMs, and management plans applicable to the Proposed Action would be\nimplemented for Alternative 3 to minimize effects during decommissioning. Cumulative impacts would\nalso be reduced since a smaller workforce would combine with that for constructing Greenlink West\nwhen Greenlink West is being constructed outside Yerington.\n\n**_3.17.4.6 No Action Alternative_**\nUnder the No Action alternative, the Project would not be developed. Therefore, there would be no\nimpacts to transportation and traffic in the analysis area.\n\n**_3.17.4.7 Relevant Required Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features, Carson_**\n**_City CRMP Standard Operating Procedures, Management Plans, and Mitigation_**\n**_Measures_**\n\n**Western Solar Plan Programmatic Design Features**\nPDFs from the Western Solar Plan are listed in Appendix B. The Project would comply with the\nfollowing PDFs to minimize impacts to transportation:\n\n-  AQC2-1\n\n-  T2-1\n\n**Carson City CRMP Standard Operating Procedures**\nSOPs from the Carson City CRMP (BLM 2001) are listed in Appendix B. The following SOPs were\nidentified to minimize transportation impacts:\n\n-  Common to All SOP 2\n\n-  Rights-of-Way Corridors SOP 4 and 5\n\n**Management Plans and Mitigation Measures**\nThe following management plans, required by the BLM ROW grant, would be relevant and implemented\nduring Project construction, O&M, and decommissioning to minimize traffic impacts:\n\n-  Dust Control and Air Quality Plan (Draft available on Project website)\n\n-  Traffic Management Plan\n\n\n-----\n\n-  Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan\n\nThe Project would comply with the following mitigation measures and MM SOC-3 from Section 3.14\nSocioeconomics to minimize adverse traffic impacts:\n\n**MM TR-1: Workforce Housing and Transportation Plan.** Under MM SOC-2, specific components of\nthe plan shall include:\n\n-  A vanpool/shuttle service shall be identified along with worker parking areas that can service an\nestimated 50-percent of the peak hour commuting workforce from northern Yerington or along\n95A to the job site.\n\n-  Workers shall be scheduled in split shifts, as feasible, to reduce peak traffic volumes.\n\n-  Traffic control measures, such as flaggers, traffic control devices, escort vehicles, and signage\nshall be dictated in the plan, particularly along the first 0.5-mile segment of East Walker Road near\nthe two residences.\n\n**MM TR 2: Traffic Management Plan Measures.** The Traffic Management Plan shall include the use of\ntraffic control measures such as traffic control devices and flaggers during high traffic periods or during\ndeliveries of large or oversized loads, particularly at the intersections of SR 827 and SR 208 and SR 208\nand East Walker Road and along the first 0.5 mile of the road near homes. Additional measures shall\ninclude:\n\n-  Identify traffic control measures needed, consistent with the requirements in the Manual of\nUniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and specify the circumstances under which each is\nrequired. Traffic control measures may include escort vehicles for wide loads, signage, and\nflaggers.\n\n-  Use static and variable message signs, as necessary, to inform drivers that there may be delays or\ntrucks entering traffic due to construction.\n\n-  Provide a breakdown of the number, type, capacity, and dimensions of the construction vehicles\nthat would service the site.\n\n-  Provide an estimate of the average daily or weekly number of vehicles per vehicle type during\neach major phase of the work.\n\n-  Identify effective and safe routes for use by passenger/worker vehicles, delivery vehicles, and\nexcavation and construction vehicles.\n\n-  Enforce the chosen construction travel routes through contractor stipulations and conditions and\nperiodic verification.\n\n-  Identify a contact for complaints and indicate how complaints should be addressed.\n\n-  Coordinate with Lyon County Roads Department and NDOT during final design to determine the\npotential need for intersection modifications and any design parameters that would be required or\ndesirable. Coordinate with landowners to establish agreements if improvements require\nencroachment onto private properties and provide the appropriate compensation and if appropriate\npost construction restoration for encroachments on private property.\n\n**MM TR 3: Road Conditions Assessment**\n\nThe Applicant shall conduct a pre-construction and post-construction road condition assessment along\nEast Walker Road. The pre-construction road condition assessment shall include photographs or a video\nrecording. The Applicant shall submit the pre-construction road condition assessment to Lyon County\nPublic Works or other applicable agency no less than 30 days prior to construction. Following\nconstruction, the Applicant shall conduct a post-construction road condition assessment. If damage to\nroads occurs as a result of construction traffic, the Applicant shall restore damaged roadways within 60\ndays after the completion of construction and decommissioning to a pre-construction condition, based on\nthe pre-construction road condition assessment, or to a condition agreed upon by the Applicant and Lyon\n\n\n-----\n\nCounty, and obtain any necessary permits. The Applicant shall also ensure maintenance of East Walker\nRoad for the life of the Project that is commensurate with its use by the Project.\n\n**_3.17.4.8 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts and Residual Effects_**\nThere would be no irreversible commitments of resources because all roads would remain in their existing\ncapacities after decommissioning of the Project, and current traffic volumes would be reestablished. Some\nresidual effects to access would occur even after application of mitigation due to the increases in traffic\nfrom construction on US 95A, SR 339, SR 827, and SR 208, East Walker Road, and Reese River Road.\nResidual effects may still be adverse due to the scale of construction.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Chapter 4 Consultation and Coordination\n\n##### 4.4 Introduction\nThis chapter summarizes the consultation and coordination activities conducted for the Project with\ninterested agencies, organizations, Tribes, and individuals. The primary goal of the NEPA publicinvolvement process is to ensure that all interested and affected parties are aware of the Project. The\nscoping period includes the initial presentation of the Project to the public and opportunities for the public\nand agency representatives to provide comments.\n\n##### 4.5 Public Involvement Process\n\n**4.5.1 Scoping**\nThe BLM published an NOI to prepare an EIS for the Project in the _Federal Register_ on April 24, 2023,\nwhich initiated a 30-day public scoping period for the Project, ending on May 24, 2023. The BLM hosted\na virtual public scoping meeting for the Project on May 8, 2023. A postcard notifying identified agencies\nand stakeholders of the scoping meeting was sent by certified mail. The scoping meeting had 15\nattendees. The BLM received 25 emails and letters during the scoping period. A Scoping Report was\nprepared to summarize the comments addressed (BLM 2023). The Scoping Report is available on the\nBLM\u2019s National BLM NEPA Register website.\n\n**4.5.2 Draft EIS Public Comment Period and Public Comments**\nThis Draft EIS was published concurrently with the publication of the Notice of Availability (NOA) in the\n_Federal Register._ The publication is followed by a 45-day public comment period to receive comments on\nthe Draft EIS. Within the 45-day public comment period, the BLM will hold an in-person and a virtual\npublic meeting to provide the public with information on the Draft EIS, respond to questions, and gather\npublic comments.\n\nA copy of the Libra Solar Project Draft EIS is available for public review at the following locations:\n\nCentral Branch Library (Lyon County)\n20 Nevin Way\nYerington, Nevada 89447\n\nMineral County Library (Hawthorne Library)\n110 1 [st] Street\nHawthorne, NV 89415\n\nBureau of Land Management, Carson City District Office\n5665 Morgan Mill Road\nCarson City, Nevada 89701\n\nThe Draft EIS is also available at: [https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022592/570](https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022592/570) .\n\n##### 4.6 Formal Consultation with Tribal Governments\nThe BLM has initiated government-to-government consultation with Indian Tribes, pursuant to Executive\nOrder 13175 of November 6, 2000 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments);\n\n\n-----\n\nSection 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA); National Environmental Policy Act\n(NEPA); American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA); and Executive Order 13007, Indian Sacred\nSites; and consistent with the Solar Programmatic Agreement (2012).\n\nThe BLM is conducting on-going government-to-government consultation with Bridgeport Indian\nColony, Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, Walker\nRiver Paiute Tribe, Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, Yerington Paiute Tribe, and Yomba\nShoshone Tribe. Key concerns include potential impacts to the Pistone-Black Mountain NCA and other\nnearby sensitive cultural sites, particularly along the gen-tie line. BLM invited the following Tribes,\nwhich are within an extended regional area, to participate in scoping: Moapa Band of Paiutes, Las Vegas\nPaiute Tribe, Kaibab Band of Paiutes, Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, Ely Shoshone Tribe, and Duckwater\nShoshone Tribe. The Moapa Band of Paiutes provided scoping comments on topics such as biological\nresources, vegetation removal, viewshed analyses, Project water use, and cultural resources.\n\nOn June 26, 2023, and July 12, 2023, the BLM hosted virtual tribal meetings to present the Project, show\nmaps of the Project facilities, and provide an overview of key resource findings based on the completed\ntechnical studies. Representatives from the Walker River Paiute Tribe, Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, and\nFallon Paiute Shoshone Tribe participated in the meetings. BLM received input regarding important\nhunting areas and concerns related to the Pistone-Black Mountain NCA that were incorporated into the\nanalysis, as appropriate.\n\nThe BLM has identified potential impacts to cultural resources in this Draft EIS and is continuing\ndiscussions with Tribes through formal and informal consultation to ensure that concerns are considered\nin proposed mitigation.\n\n##### 4.7 National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Consultation\nSection 106 of the NHPA (54 USC \u00a7 306108), and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR 800, requires\nfederal agencies to consider the effects of proposed projects (undertakings) on any historic properties, and\nto provide the ACHP and opportunity to comment. The BLM initiated Section 106 consultation with the\nACHP and the Nevada SHPO on April 14, 2023. The NHPA, and its implementing regulations, provide\nguidance for using NEPA to comply with Section 106. Specifically, the regulations at 36 CFR 800.8(c),\nallow a federal agency to use the NEPA environmental review process to comply with Section 106 of the\nNHPA in lieu of the procedures set forth in 36 CFR 800.3 - 800.6.\n\nThe BLM is using the environmental review process to fulfill its requirements to consider effects to\nhistoric properties under Section 106 of the NHPA. As part of the process, the BLM notified the ACHP,\nthe SHPO, Indian Tribes, and all consulting parties that the BLM will use the environmental review\nprocess to meet the Section 106 compliance requirements, consistent with 36 CFR 800.8(c) on April 14,\n2023. Indian Tribes have also been invited to participate specifically in the NEPA review and under\nSection 106 of the NHPA.\n\n##### 4.8 Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation\nThreatened, endangered, proposed, or candidate species, as identified under the ESA, would not be\nimpacted by the Project. No Section 7 consultation was required as part of the Project. The USFWS is a\nCooperating Agency.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.9 Cooperating Agency Coordination\nIn July 2022, the BLM sent Cooperating Agency invitation letters for the Project to the following federal,\nstate, local agencies, and Indian Tribes.\n\n\n**_Federal_**\nBureau of Indian Affairs, Western Nevada\nAgency\nUS Fish and Wildlife Service\nUS Army Corps of Engineers\nUS Environmental Protection Agency\nUS Department of Defense (Hawthorne Army\nDepot)\nUS Bureau of Reclamation\nUS National Parks Service\n\n**_State of Nevada_**\nState Historic Preservation Office\nNevada State Parks\nNV Energy\nNevada Department of Environmental\nProtection\nNevada Department of Transportation\nNevada Department of Wildlife\nNevada Division of Water Resources\nNevada Department of Conservation and Natural\nResources\nNevada Department of Forestry\n\n\n**_Local Agencies_**\nLyon County\nMineral County\nChurchill County\nCity of Yerington\n\n**_Tribal governments_**\nBridgeport Indian Colony\nFallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe\nPyramid Lake Paiute Tribe\nReno-Sparks Indian Colony\nWalker River Paiute Tribe\nWashoe Tribe of Nevada and California\nYerington Paiute Tribe\nYomba Shoshone Tribe\nMoapa Band of Paiutes\nLas Vegas Paiute Tribe\nKaibab Band of Paiutes\nPaiute Indian Tribe of Utah\nEly Shoshone Tribe\nDuckwater Shoshone Trib\n\n\nThe Cooperating Agencies that accepted Cooperating Agency invitation include USEPA, Hawthorne\nArmy Depot, USFWS Migratory Bird Program, NDOW, Mineral County, and Lyon County. The BLM\nconducted a Cooperating Agency kick-off meeting for the Project, as well as additional meetings on\nalternatives for the Proposed Action, to gather input from the agencies for the NEPA analysis. The\nCooperating Agencies also participated in review of administrative draft documents for the Draft EIS, as\nwell as review of resource reports, studies, and modeling utilized for the NEPA analysis.\n\nThe BLM provided notification of the publication, including a link to the document location, of the Draft\nEIS to the seven federal, nine state, four local agencies listed above, and the eight tribal governments\nidentified in Section 4.6 for government-to-government consultation.\n\n##### 4.10  Next Steps in the NEPA Process\n\nUpon receipt and consideration of the public comments on the Draft EIS, the BLM will publish the Final\nEIS. The BLM would then publish the ROD and, potentially, authorize the ROW application. The ROD\nwould identify the selected alternative for the Project.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Chapter 5 Literature Cited and List of Preparers\n\n##### 5.1 List of Preparers\n\n|Table 5.1-1  BLM|Staff Contributing to the Preparation of the EIS|\n|---|---|\n|Contributor|Role/responsibility|\n|Frank Giles|State Air Resource Specialist (Air Quality)|\n|Wyatt Fereday|Hydrologist (Water Resources and Soils)|\n|Niki Cutler|Hydrologist (Jurisdictional Waters, Soils)|\n|Christine McCollum|Archaeologist (Cultural Resources, Native American, Paleontology)|\n|Jonathan Gordon|Wildlife Biologist (Wildlife, Endangered Species)|\n|Mark Mazza|Rangeland Management Specialist (Rangeland)|\n|Dean Tonenna|Botanist (Threatened or Endangered Plant Species, Sensitive Plants)|\n|Lawrence Rose|Rangeland Management Specialist, Weeds Coordinator (Noxious and Invasive, Non-Native)|\n|John Axtell|Wild Horse and Burro Specialist (Wild Horses and Burros)|\n|Paul Amar|Outdoor Recreation Planner (Recreation, Wilderness, Travel Management)|\n|Jason Wright|Archaeologist (Visual Resources)|\n|Matthew Fockler|Socioeconomic Specialist (Socioeconomics, Environmental Justice)|\n|Dave Schroeder|Environmental Protection Specialist (Wastes \u2013 Hazardous or Solid, Geothermal Resources)|\n|Don Shannon|Fire Ecologist (Public Health and Safety, Fire Management)|\n|Taylor Burnham|Geologist (Geology \u2013 Minerals and Materials)|\n|Terah Malsam|Realty Specialist (Lands and Realty, Assistant Project Manager)|\n|Kim Dow|Carson City District Manager and Acting Field Manager, Sierra Front Field Office|\n|Shedra Rakestraw|Assistant Field Office Manager, Sierra Front Field Office|\n|Melanie Hornsby|Planning and Environmental Coordinator, Military Liaison (NEPA Compliance, Project Manager)|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 5.1-2** **Third Party Consultants**\n\n|Contributor|Role/responsibility|\n|---|---|\n|Tania Treis|Panorama, Project Manager, Soils, Water Resources|\n|Keri Hill|Panorama, Deputy Project Manager, Visual Resources, Rangeland, Transportation and Traffic|\n|Aaron Lui|Panorama, Senior Manager, Visual Resources|\n|Jenna Savois|Panorama, Planner, Environmental Justice, Socioeconomics, Air Quality, Cultural Resources, Native American Religious Concerns|\n|Kelsey Patterson|Panorama, Senior Planner/Biologist, Wildlife, Vegetation and Noxious Weeds|\n|Garret Peterson|Panorama, Planner, Recreation, Land Use and Realty|\n|Miriam Liberatore|Panorama, Public Health and Safety|\n|Lacar Musgrove|Panorama, Technical Editing, QA/QC|\n|Edward Stoner|ASM Affiliates, Cultural Resources|\n|Ryan Young|Phoenix Biological Consulting, Small Mammal Trapping Study, Botanical Survey Report, Eagle Nesting Survey Report, Migratory Bird Survey Report, Bat Acoustic Study, Jurisdictional Delineation Report,|\n|Mike Ratte|RCH Group, Air Quality Technical Report|\n|Jeff Moffett|Triple Point Strategic Consulting LLC, Economic and Fiscal Impact Assessment|\n|Tony Dimpel|McGinley and Associates (Now Universal Engineering Sciences), Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment|\n|Ken Loy|West Yost Affiliates, Groundwater Impact Analysis|\n|Westwood|Preliminary Drainage Study|\n|Travis Jokerst|EnviroMine, Due Diligence Report|\n\n\n\n##### 5.2 Literature Cited\nAbella, Scott R. 2010. \u201cDisturbance and Plant Succession in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of the\nAmerican Southwest.\u201d _International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health_ 7 (4): 1248\u2013\n84.
